Although a very serious subject, this movie is a comedy.The punch lines are to the point and absolutely hilarious.

After The Grand Budapest Hotel, this movie comes as a breath of fresh air."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Having recently won the People's Choice Awards at TIFF, Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is very easy to see why it won.Three Billboards is a dark but also funny and heart-felt story about one woman's quest to get justice for her daughter's rape and murder. After Mildred Haynes buys three billboards with words written on them accusing the town's well-liked sheriff of having not found her daughter's killer, it sets a series of events that turns the citizens and the cops against her.The thing I can say about Three Billboards without going into spoilers is that it is wildly unpredictable. One moment you think things are going one direction as expected then it takes hard left turn that only adds to the dynamic between the characters. As the pressure within the town builds and anger is pointed towards Mildred, we see many of these characters evolve in order to deal with tragedy and grief and learn to find peace. And the movie goes through a roller-coaster of emotions. One moment you are laughing your butt off from the hilarious dialogue then you feel like someone just punched you in the gut. With every victory you think this story brings you feel like it was taken away from because of the world's unfairness and injustice. In lesser hands the mixture of dark and comedic tones would not work, but director and writer Martin McDonagh knows how to balance them to perfection.The performances here just through the roof. Frances McDormand delivers a performance that will for sure get her into the Lead Actress awards race at the Oscars. As Mildred, McDormand just cuts loose with her performance with every line of hate, cynicism and cursing towards everyone she feels doesn't truly understand the internal pain she is going through. But McDormand does now and then show a soft side to Mildred. It shows that Mildred is just person like everyone who has her own way of dealing with the tragedy of loosing her own child. And Sam Rockwell also gives one of the best performances of his career as the flawed and very misguided cop Dixon. The character of Dixon is short-tempered, volatile, and not bright with some baggage of his own that the locals accuse him of. But Sam Rockwell brings his charm and sincerity to what could be a rather unlikable character. And in the latter half, you see Dixon go through a tremendous arc of learning to care about others rather then just being angry towards them. Other great performances that should be called out are Woody Harrelson, Peter Dinklage, John Hawk and Caleb Landry Jones.Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best movies this year and is worth seeing once it comes out in wide releases."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "It seemed that the pregnant police detective Marge Gunderson from 'Fargo' would forever be the most memorable character of Frances McDormand's acting career. But now I'm not so sure. Mildred Hayes, the heroine from 'Three Billboards', is a serious contender. This might well be her best performance ever.The part of Mildred Hayes was written with McDormand in mind. Hayes is a divorced single mother, living with her son on the outskirts of a small, remote town. She had a daughter too, but the girl was raped and killed on a quiet mountain road not far from home. Frustrated by the lack of progress of the investigation, Hayes decides to rent three dilapidated billboards, publicly accusing the local police chief of incompetence. By doing so, she attracts the attention of the media, angers almost the entire town and causes a succession of increasingly violent actions.Although the film is about grief, anger, revenge and violence, it is extremely funny. Above all because of Mildred Hayes' stubborn character and her ability to verbally humiliate people by her extremely sharp tongue. The monologue she delivers when a priest visits her house to tell her she has gone too far, is priceless.Apart from McDormand's performance, the screenplay is another great feature of this film. The story is full of unexpected twists, gradually shifting the positions of the main characters towards each other. None of the characters are one-dimensional: they all reveal surprising parts of their personalities as the story moves forward.And then there is the overall, almost Coen-esque atmosphere of a small town full of colourful characters. There is a racist cop, a friendly midget, a smart advertising guy and a pretty girl who is so dumb she doesn't know the difference between polo and polio.It is hard to mention something negative about this film. 'Three Billboards' is, from start to finish, a great movie. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "I won't even try and sum up all my feelings about this movie because no matter what I'd write, it wouldn't do it justice.What l'll say is that it's brilliant, it's dark, it's hilarious - and not in a slapstick-funny-kind of way but in an authentic and real funny kind of way - and it transitions so effortlessly between that hilarity and despair that I was captivated throughout the entire film.McDormand shines. Rockwell shines. Harrelson shines.Everyone shines.So far, for me, this has best screenplay, best actress in a leading roll and maybe even best actor in a supporting roll written all over it.Every film lover is gonna talk about this gem in a couple of weeks/months and I'm sure that every film lover is gonna absolutely love this film.Thank you, Martin McDonagh!(9.1/10)"}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "So far, this film has an IMDb rating of 8.3...and this is extraordinarily high. But the film has been in festivals and I am sure the rating will change some when the film is in general release. As for me, I think it's incredibly overrated.The story is about an angry mom, Mildred (Frances McDormand). Her daughter was brutally murdered and raped...and the police haven't been able to do anything with the case. So, in desperation and anger, she rents out three billboards and calls the local Police Chief (Woody Harrelson) to task for this. Surprisingly, most of the town comes down against Mildred...who was just exercising her First Amendment rights. What happens from there...well, just see the film.There were many wonderful scenes and characters in this picture. But, there were also many main characters who were just god-awful and unlikable...including Mildred! In fact, later in the film when she thinks the police department has wronged her, she burns down the building and accidentally flames one of the cops! So, no one who is a main character in the film is nice or likable...making this movie a bit of a hard-sell. Too much cussing (even by 2017 standards), very crude language and overall nastiness prevent this one from being a must- see film."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "I had the pleasure of seeing the local premiere of Three Billboard outside of Ebbing, Missouri tonight at the Paramount Theater as part of Austin Film Festival. The film's style and humor is reminiscent of some of the better early Coen Brothers films (Blood Simple, Fargo, and Raising Arizona). The writer/director has basically stolen their style. Basically, a story that on paper is very dark and serious played with characters that are essentially humorous for dark comedic effect. The presence of Francis McDormand more-or- less completes the linkage. (She may well earn another Oscar nomination.) The film is deeply disturbing built around a mother's quest for justice after her daughter's violent death, themes of death and dying, police incompetence and brutality, and hints of racism and spousal abuse. At the same time, it can be hysterically funny and absurd. You want to laugh during one scene and cry during the next. The dis-functionality of just about every character is somehow both disturbing and hilarious. I think like the Coen Brothers, writer/director Martin McDonagh want you to take the issues raised seriously, but perhaps not to take ourselves too seriously. Overall, the acting and directing by a stellar cast is first-rate. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates this sort of dark comedy."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a dark comedy that has an a-list cast with names like Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, John Hawkes, and Peter Dinklage. It centers around Mildred Hayes, a woman whose daughter was raped and killed, and who believes that the local police have not done enough about it. In reaction, she erects three billboards outside of her town that send a message to the sheriff about the state of the investigation.Writer/director Martin McDonagh (Seven Psychopaths, In Bruges) has outdone himself with this one. In my opinion, if this isn't one of the top Oscar contenders come awards season, then Hollywood has officially lost its mind.Basically everything about this film works: from the acting, to the writing, to the direction. Mcdormand gives the performance of her career here, giving us humor through all the pain clearly shown on her face. Rockwell also gives his best performance here as a cop who isn't that bright and is more than a little racist. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is probably the most unpredictable film of the year, and that's coming from a year that includes films like Baby Driver and Logan. There are scenes where you think that you know where the plot is going, but then midway through it completely flips the script. For the entire run-time of this film, I was invested. It has the perfect run-time; it ends exactly when it needs to and there is not a scene that feels out of place. It seems like one of the hardest things to do in film nowadays is to balance comedy and drama. However, this movie does it effortlessly. Each scene has just the right amount of comedy and drama, and sometimes, despite the fact that you're laughing, it's easy to forget that jokes are being made.Also, the message that this film gives off resonates very powerfully with you after the film finishes. It makes you see the good side in humanity, despite our flaws. No character in this film is a clich\u00e9 one-dimensional shell of a person. Everybody has a reason for being there, which is more than some films recently have offered.Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best and most enjoyable films of 2017, and it will make you laugh, cry, and think all in one sitting.

They must love the succulent stew of characters he cooks up, because he catches the very best. I can't find enough superlatives for Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. They are, here as in everything they've ever been in, great. They are ably supported by Woody Harrelson, Caleb Landry Jones, Clarke Peters, Sandy Martin, Lucas Hedges, John Hawkes, Amanda Warren. The only weak link in this superb ensemble is Abbie Cornish, who is warm and smiley but is unfortunately out of her depth: a very odd piece of casting.Cinematography, production design, costume, editing, music - they're all top of the range.

I have written the summary many times and i have erased in every occasion. So i decided to show some dots in the summary. That is the symbol of how excellent the movie is.The plot :The plot is very much uncommon. it has so many facts that it offers you a guessing 2 hour while you goes through the movie. It provides enough backbone to the rest of the element of the movie. It creates a concrete base upon which the movie stands firmly.The mystery :As the movie deals with a murder it contains enough mystery to shake the audiences. Scene after scene all this unpacked. But they have to wait till the end to solve the puzzles.The resistance : The movie is about the resistance of a mother. It starts with the desperate mission of a mother to bring the killers of her daughter to light. Those billboards, the sudden attacks, burgaining against the local authority.. all these are the part of a resistant mother which is also the part and parcel of the movie.Acting :Acting in my view is up to the mark. Frances Mcdormand is exquisite in her role as a mother seeking justice. Others have also come to the party.Direction :This is the characterstics of the movie i was most impressed with. Although the plot and the acting is out of question but it is the director who has the sole credit to connect all this. He has slowly but cleverly unfolded all the sector available. He is good enough to make the movie what it looks like in the projector. He has turned the raw materials to a mature masterpiece.Questions and answers :last of all the main event is the answers of the question that were aroused during the first session of the movie. You have to wait to find the answers. This waiting makes it more attractive.So clearly it is a movie of great quality..a bit older type..but you know old is gold.."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "It goes without saying that dark comedy is very difficult to accomplish. I would almost say it's harder to pull off than regular comedy because you need to be able to keep people invested in the dramatic aspect of the film, while still keeping them laughing throughout the majority of the duration. Director Martin McDonagh has matured as a filmmaker over the years, starting off with In Bruges, which was pretty much a flat-out comedy, to Seven Psychopaths, which placed him a little further into the spotlight, but I must admit that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is not only his best film to date, but also one of the best films I've received the pleasure of witnessing all year. From laughter to genuine tension and heart, this is a film that's pretty much perfect all around. Here is why I can recommend this film to everyone.After the tragic death of her daughter, Mildred Hayes calls out the local authorities on three billboards, publicly stating that they're not doing their jobs and not a single arrest has happened since the death of her daughter. While publicly displaying this is upsetting to some, she sees it as a point being made. Through some very cleverly written humor throughout the entire film, levity is brought to the table in times of sorrow, making this a very easy movie to watch. Although the story itself is quite depressing, this film is written in a way that will still find a way to make you smile.From the very first few frames of this film, you can tell the tone will be handled perfectly. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh with pure class, you can tell that he was very passionate when bringing this film to fruition. Every line of dialogue either progressed the story along, developed a character, made the audience laugh, or provided deep insight into the event of the murder itself. While not having the bearings of a conventional murder mystery, many viewers may not like the way this film concludes, but in the context of the movie as a whole and everything it's setting out to accomplish, it really does have a realistic and true finale.It's arguable that some of the law enforcement officers play just as significant a role as Mildred does throughout the film, being pretty much present every time a revelation occurs, but I gravitated the most towards Officer Dixon. I've always been a huge fan of Sam Rockwell, and his character here is one of the most essential to this story, set on being there from beginning to end, trying his absolute best to be of any help. While Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Chief Willoughby is by far the most important to the story at hand, it's the characters around him that drive him to his actions throughout the course of the movie. The characters are truly what make this film as likable as it is, and they're all wonderfully drawn.Overall, when looking back on my experience watching Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, I find myself not being able to wait until its official theatrical release to watch it again. I found this film to be stellar in every sense of the word. From a noteworthy performance by Francis McDormand, devoted secondary performances, a screenplay that will have you consistently laughing, while also being emotionally involved with the serious storyline at hand, and pulling the audience in with its subtly composed score, everything about this film is worth praise. This was a huge surprise for me and I can't recommend you checking it out enough. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a fantastic piece of modern cinema."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "We saw this last week at a special screening as part of the SAG Film Society series and it just blew everything else we had seen away! I really loved Breathe and Wild River, but this was not only riveting in its development and surprising in its plot twists, but just fascinating to watch. The plot is crafted like an intricate puzzle that slowly spins out as the characters interact and react in completely unpredictable ways. The only thing I did NOT like about it is the ending, because I felt it not only left the audience hanging in the middle of the film, without resolving to a satisfying (for me) conclusion, but I also did not want it to END! That's how fascinating the characterizations are. McDormand and Rockwell are both standouts, but Harrelson definitely holds his own with them, as well as all of the supporting cast. I don't usually write reviews, but this was so memorable that I had to post something. I will not give anything away because it is better the less you know, but GO SEE IT!!!"}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Martin McDonagh's new film is an incendiary dark comedy that has some tonal similarities with his two previous films, \"In Bruges\" and \"Seven Psychopaths.\" However, this film is also plenty unique, and while not perfect, it's a wickedly thoughtful while also somber film due to its plot and general merits. The film tells the story of a woman in a small town in Missouri who puts up three billboards to depict her disapproval of the local police chief's failure to investigate her daughter's rape and murder. Gleefully profane and politically incorrect, the film's no-holds-barred script generally works to create dramatic irony, tension and a sense of collective outrage. However, there are a few moments where its more hyperbolic senses fail to create the intended effect on viewers--or come across as if such writing devices are simply trying too hard to do so. \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" should be commended for its exceptional acting. Frances McDormand's performance in the lead role is simply outstanding. She manages to pull off a genuine sense of grief combined with a twisted and engaging sense of humor that complements her otherwise-serious characterization quite well. The supporting cast is impressive as well, particularly Woody Harrelson's role as the police chief. Despite these unique strengths, the film does also contain some flaws. The climax and ending happen to go on too long for no particular reason, and there are portions of the film that do feel slightly atonal. However, this is a generally well-made and certainly well-acted dark comedy. Recommended. 7.5/10"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Greetings again from the darkness. Once out of our teen years (though some take a bit longer), the vast majority of us accept the obvious truth to the adage \"life is not fair\". Despite this, we never outgrow our desire for justice when we feel wronged. Uber- talented playwright/screenwriter/director Martin McDonagh delivers a superb drama blended with a type of dark comedy that allows us to deal with some pretty heavy, and often unpleasant small town happenings.Oscar winner Frances McDormand plays Mildred, a grieving mother whose daughter was abducted and violently murdered. With the case having gone cold, Mildred is beyond frustrated and now desperate to prevent her daughter from being forgotten. To light the proverbial fire and motivate the local police department to show some urgency in solving her daughter's case, Mildred uses the titular billboards to make her point and target the Police Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). The billboards cause quite the ruckus as the media brings extra attention, which in turn creates conflict between Mildred and the police department, the town citizens, and even her own son (Lucas Hedges). The film could have been titled 'The Wrath of Mildred' if not for so many other facets to the story and characters with their own layers. Her anger is certainly understandable, though some of her actions are impossible to defend. Things can never again be square in the life of a parent who has lost a child, yet vengeance is itself a lost cause.Mr. McDonagh's exceptional script utilizes twisted comedy to deal with the full spectrum of dark human emotions: managing the deepest grief, anger, guilt, and need for revenge. As in his Oscar winning script for the contemporary classic IN BRUGES (2008), his dialogue plays as a strange type of poetry, delivering some of the most harsh and profane lines in melodic fashion. In addition to his nonpareil wordsmithing, Mr. McDonagh and casting director Sarah Finn have done a remarkable job at matching many talented performers with the characters \u2013 both large roles and small. Following up her Emmy winning performance in \"Olive Kitteridge\", Ms. McDormand is yet again a force of nature on screen. She would likely have dominated the film if not for the effectively understated portrayal by Mr. Harrelson, and especially the best supporting performance of the year courtesy of Sam Rockwell. His Officer Dixon is a racist with out-of-control anger issues who still lives with his mom (a brilliant Sandy Martin, who was also the grandma in NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE). Caleb Landry Jones once again shows his uncanny ability to turn a minor role into a character we can't take our eyes off (you'll remember his screen debut as one of the bike riding boys near the end of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN). Here he plays Red, the owner of the billboards with an inner desire to carry some clout. Rounding out the absurdly deep cast are Zeljko Ivanek, Kerry Condon, Lucas Hedges (MANCHESTER BY THE SEA), Peter Dinklage, John Hawkes, Abbie Cornish, and Clarke Peters (the epitome of a new Sheriff in town). Every actor has at least one moment (and monologue) to shine, and one of the best scenes (of the year) involves Nick Searcy as a Priest getting schooled on \"culpability\" by Mildred.Cinematographer Ben Davis has a nice blend of \"big\" movies (AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON) and small (TAMARA DREWE) in his career, and here he really captures the feel of the small town and interactions of the characters. Also adding to the film's excellence is the folksy, western score (with a touch of dueling gunfighters) by Carter Burwell. And keeping the streak alive \u0085 it's yet another worth-watching film featuring a Townes Van Zandt song.Not many films dare tackle the list of topics and issues that are touched on here: church arrogance, police violence, racism, cancer, domestic violence, questioning the existence of God, parental grief with a desire for revenge, the weight of a guilty conscience, and the influence of parents in a rural setting. The film is superbly directed by Mr. McDonagh, who now has delivered two true classics in less than a decade. It's the uncomfortable laughs that make life in Ebbing tolerable, but it's the pain and emotions that stick with us long after the credits roll. Sometimes we need a reminder that fairness in the world should not be expected, and likely does not exist. If that's true, what do we do with our anger? McDonagh offers no easy answers, because there are none. But he does want us to carefully consider our responses."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. When a film is so highly spoken about it can mean one of two things: 1) It's going to be a great film, or 2) the praise is being overstate. Unfortunately, \"Three Billboards...\" falls into the later category, as director/writer Martin McDonagh (\"Seven Psychopaths\" 2012) presents an intriguing dark comedy that ultimately comes across as a variety of individual scenes put together to make a story. Featuring Frances McDormand (\"Fargo\"), Woody Harrelson (\"The Hunger Games\"), Sam Rockwell (\"The Way Way Back\"), Luca Hedges (\"Manchester by the Sea\"), Caleb Landrey (\"Get Out\"), Zeljko Ivanek (\"Argo\") and Peter Dinklage (\"Game of Thrones\"), the acting is not the problem here. McDonagh's sets are stagy, his writing is lackluster, he tends to add in scenes/character in order to oddly move the story along, and the ending does nothing for the flow of the film. Standing out in this heavily star packed film is Caleb Landrey. Landrey is initially had to understand, due to an unexplainable accent, however, he over comes this weakness by graciously playing the victim. \"Three Billboards\" is far from a clunker. I guess I just expected a more tightly woven and satisfying production."}, {"score": "4/10", "review": "\"Anger begets greater anger.\" says Penelope (Samara Weaving), Mildred's (Frances McDormand) ex-husband's totally non stereotypical nineteen year old new girlfriend, who delivers the film's theme in what is supposed to be another comedic moment where we are all supposed to laugh at this beautiful but shallow girl's attempt at sounding smart, and yet, it falls flat, like the vast majority of both dramatic and comedic moments.I just want to clarify before going any further that In Bruges, Martin McDonagh's directorial debut, is one of my absolute favorite films. One that navigates comedy and drama perfectly, brilliantly written and acted, I could go on for days on how perfect In Bruges is, in my humble opinion.Sadly, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri fails miserably where In Bruges succeeded. It constantly tries to navigate the difficult line between dark comedy and drama, and mostly, it falls flat on its head.The thematic thread may be to blame here. Without spoiling the plot, the setup is simple: Frances McDormand wants some form of justice for her daughter's brutal murder. She gets the local police department's attention by setting up three billboards complaining about their inability to solve the case. But her action only generates more conflict in town and while it does draw attention to her daughter's case, it leads to increasing tension between her and pretty much everyone else around her. Her anger literally begets more anger and, ultimately, solves nothing.This is a surprisingly simple moralistic viewpoint coming from the man whose first film was so morally complex and ambiguous and it results in the creation of equally shallow characters and a plot that desperately tries to make sense of its many pointless turns.To be fair, McDonagh attempts to humanize its more prominent characters: Mildred (McDormand), in spite of being a tough and wooden most of the time, shows deep vulnerability in an unfortunately insufferably cheesy monologue she gives to a deer. Meanwhile, Dixon (Sam Rockwell), the \"black torturer,\" displays humanity later in the movie and tries really hard to find redemption when he is shown the way.Unfortunately those attempts are so sudden and awkward or poorly executed that they lack believability and feel like they were artificially implemented to make these characters seem deeper than they really are.Throughout the film, it feels like the filmmaker is more interested in hammering his simplistic viewpoint and using small town America as a perfect setting for it - even though it never feels like he has actually ever spent time there - than to craft a story with a coherent through line and inhabited by humane, relatable characters.There was so much talent involved in the making of this film - and in spite of everything, Sam Rockwell delivers a stellar performance - that it is truly frustrating that the end result be so mediocre. Hopefully, McDonagh will course correct on his next film."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "I saw this film at TIFF in Sept, and it is absolutely brilliant.

However, given the subject matter of the script that was also directed by \"Seven Psychopaths\" writer/director Martin McDonagh, I will be interested to see how it is accepted by a mass audience. Submitted for your perusal:Mildred (Frances McDormand) lives in the small town of Ebbing, Missouri, where she is mourning the brutal death of her daughter. Nine months have passed with no leads, no arrests, and no real questions answered. Her grief in this time has gotten more and more intense, and she decides to take matters in her own hands by bringing more awareness to her community in a grand matter, getting the attention of local sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), his direct report Dixon (Sam Rockwell), and an entire community of people who take sides in a tale of the consequences of the choices we make as well as the consequences of those consequences.Like I alluded to earlier, this is definitely not for everyone. Listed on IMDb as a \"darkly comic drama,\" they ain't lyin'. There is subject matter in \"Three Billboards\" on multiple levels that could make the sensitive types a bit uneasy. The odd part here is that I cannot really get into all of them without leading you down the primrose path of spoilers, so you just need to kind of roll with me on this one. And to truly convey not only the subject matter but even McDonagh's script itself, it takes a special kind of cast, and he went out and got the right people here. McDormand (who is always on her \"A\" game) continues her streak of great performances here bringing what could easily be portrayed as a woman devoid of emotion and almost downright detestable and making her on some levels a sympathetic character. Mildred's anger fuels her, even in the wrong ways in some cases, but the maternal side of her reminds her that she still needs to be a role model to her surviving child in a son, Robbie (Lucas Hedges). Harrelson continues to wow me here as the lawman that really wants to do the right thing, even in facing adversity in both his professional and personal lives and works well with McDormand and Rockwell by understanding what the dynamics have to be dealing with both characters. And if you know me, you know what a fan or Rockwell's I am, and he also does not disappoint as the cop that knows that this is really his only course of career after growing up in the same small town he wants to protect if it wasn't for the fact that he just cannot seem to get out of his own way. Peter Dinklage also has a great turn here in less of a role, but his character of James becomes very important as the third act progresses, and it all comes together in a well-crafted story that takes some turns that even caught me off- guard in a way that was a bit shocking without being \"shock value\" and adds more layers to the story in the way that McDonagh has shown with his past work in films like \"In Bruges\" and \"Six Shooter\".I truly enjoyed \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" more than I expected to, even after being told by multiple colleagues and friends how much they enjoyed it. I would not be surprised if there is at least a small buzz for members of this cast when hardware starts becoming a factor in our consciousness here in a couple of months, and with the end-of-year push hitting full throttle ahead of us for the next one hundred and forty-four days, this film may be able to find its niche amongst them."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Three Billboard's is a movie that stays with you for a while.

Not a single line of dialogue is delivered with the premise of you bursting out laughing. Three Billboards is what it is. Unapologetically politically incorrect and gritty. Martin McDonagh piles it all on high like a plate at Thanksgiving dinner (to make a timely reference). But consequently, it gives the film a charm of it's own and a poignancy that is unmistakable. Reminiscent of the great films of the Coen Bros. and Quentin Tarantino, Three Billboards takes itself as far as it can go down the dark comedy rabbit hole and you will be smitten by that instantly. Three Billboards is a remarkable film and the most memorable film I've seen this year.Frances McDormand, in what can only be described as her most commanding on-screen performance since Fargo, plays Mildred Hayes. The grieving, blisteringly vengeful mother of a young girl raped and murdered by an unknown psychopath. In righteous indignation, she rents out Three billboards, that just so happen to be outside of Ebbing, Missouri (as the title suggests), that bluntly criticize the police department of Ebbing for what she sees as incompetence. \"Raped while dying,\" \"And still no arrests,\" \"How come, Chief Willoughby?\" they read. Chief Willoughby, played by Woody Harrelson, takes offense by the billboards as he feels it unfairly targets him, especially coming on the heels of his cancer diagnosis. Backed up in outraged is Officer Jason Dixon, played by Sam Rockwell, in a role that seems tailor made for a young Michael Rooker . Officer Dixon is the world's stupidest cop and the most bigoted for sure. As time goes on, the outrage comes to ahead when a new specific tragedy (that I won't spoil) happens to Chief Willoughby. Defiant, Mildred insists that the billboards stay up. The tables have turned for Dixon, who now has a righteous anger of his own. Desperate for revenge, he tries to get back at Mildred, only to reap what he has sowed, by chance, in a Molotov cocktail attack on the police station. Also, by sheer chance, he runs into who he thinks is the killer of Mildred's daughter and to atone for his bad cops sins, tries his best to indite the SOB.What is this movie getting at? A simple tale of the madness of current American society at it's core. Nobody is ever who they seem and we all aren't perfect. Also, how fate can change lives and the perspectives of themselves and others on a dime. Furthermore, tragedy and hate tend to become vicious cycles, as we all like to blame some kind of scapegoat to heal ourselves. It never does. Three Billboards cuts deep, even as it takes itself not very seriously... or so we think? The characters all curse up a storm and beat each other up, yet they all cry real tears. Can a film this strange make you feel the feels? The answer is it does. By some miracle, it does."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Questions and accusations go hand in hand when everyone knows everyone. Mildred has thrown up a three-part whooper of an interrogative just on the outskirts of town, just so any newcomers are privy to the neglect that burns through her faded, but defiant jumpsuit.The billboards' target lands on Chief Willoughby, a rugged yet compassionate family man, who loves saying \"goddamn\", and his force provides all the opportunities to pull it out. A man capable of viewing the larger picture in a speck of a town, he spatters red in attempts to wipe the advertising demons out of mind. Mildred has always spoken with her hands, and the moment she once spoke spiteful words haunts her to this day. Holy men, and blue men have no chance of cooling her. They are all culpable for the breakfast silences and cereal fights. Her son, Robbie, writhes in discomfort as she disregards reputation with crotch kicks and viral marketing.Officer Dixon is more of a short fuse than a racist, but particular sins float to the surface. His actions are deplorable, yet his heart rests in his momma's lap. He is the canine companion of Willoughby, and acts in contradiction to the Chief's every command. This zealot disciple might just be an incarnate desire emerging from a red wall. The inter-connectivity of small town living makes for scolding tempers and egregious lack of judgments. When a big city crime creeps into their preservation, Ebbing inhabitants end up making unlikely friends and easy enemies. Arson becomes untraceable, but the motive is as clear as the pain of a lost child, or perhaps husband.McDonagh has wrangled his wacky surrealism into a heart-stabbing community drama complete with genuine surprises and courageous late chapter restraint. Falling in love with the most slimy characters reveals how truly empathetic his vision was in creating a mystery with no clues and only heartache and growth."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Why is the top category for this film listed as \"comedy\"? Yeah, there are a few sequences of grim gallows humor, but this is 95% a dead-serious drama, with heavy emphasis on the \"dead\" part. Fantastic performances all around, and not a single flat character in the entire film: every one of them a fully rounded individual. No easy outs in the plot department, either, as the movie unfolds the way life itself does \u2014 unpredictably \u2014 often worse than you expected, sometimes better.Frances McDormand should be up for an Oscar for this one."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Thought provoking seems to be a dirty idea for the film industry. Audiences are not accustomed to such a alien form of entertainment. Martin McDonagh style will not be everyone's cup-a, and thank the Gods it is not. Any great new art form is never realized by the masses. Three Billboards was my third taste of his for cinema. My first was a Broadway play, best and most original and violent piece I had ever seen on the stage.Seven Psychopaths was the best script that year but the film within a film within another film went over the heads of most. Three Billboards is not nearly as funny but oh so remarkable, People will undoubtedly compare his style to Quentin Tarantino but that would be a mistake. The main difference is Tarantino's DNA is all about being COOL.His total identity is to be COOL. McDonagh's is far more intriguing and human.I would love to see his take on the current ridiculous witch hunt in Hollywood as to who touched who, who grabbed what. Do they really expect people to take this seriously. The casting couch has been around since silent films. It comes with the territory if one wants to play. Yes there are Pigs that can take advantage of girls.Trust me they take advantage of men just as frequently, maybe more.Years ago I was asked by my best friend to be an extra in a Halloween Scene meant to be NYC. In that scene I was told to stand next to Salma Hayek when out of nowhere she grabbed my ass. I've been having nightmares ever since, and that was at least 20 years ago.SHOULD I SUE? LOL.Three billboards has so many scenes to be cherished, but the one which is in the only flashback, will send chills up your spine to alert you as to why the mother is so obsessed to find the one person responsible for raping,killing and burning her daughter. The GUILT,Oh so much guilt."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "From Martin McDonagh, director of In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths, comes Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. If you liked his other films, you'll love Three Billboards. Once again, a large cast of characters who are just just far enough out there to be funny, but grounded enough to be realistic find what should be an ordinary situation rapidly escalating out of control.Frances McDormand stars as Mildred Hays, a grieving mother who decides the best way to encourage the police to solve her daughter's brutal murder is to put up three billboards outside town calling out the chief of police. That is enough to lite a fire under the town, quite literally, as the dying Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), his intellectually-challenged mamma's boy officer (Sam Rockwell), the town midget (Peter Dinklage), the man who owns the billboards (Caleb Landry Jones), and Mildred ex-husband (John Hawkes) all end up on a crash course towards each other. As they say \"Anger just begets greater anger\" and there is a lot of anger in Ebbing, Missouri.Amazingly, a movie that is essentially nonstop chaos and overreactions manages to actually develop its characters and have them grow. None of the characters are simply caricatures, save a couple very minor roles, and they all have more depth than most movies would have given them."}, {"score": "5/10", "review": "\"Three Billboards\" follows Andrea Arnold's \"American Honey\" (2016) and Edgar Wright's \"Baby Driver\" (2017) as part of a trend towards British auteur filmmakers writing and directing movies set in America. But whilst the two earlier films were humanistic and optimistic portrayals of American life which didn't reduce Americans to stereotypes, \"Three Billboards\" feels trite and reductionist, and does not show the hallmarks of being written by someone who has ever spent much time in small-town America.Apart from the strong accents there is very little attempt to create a sense of place - we get no establishing shots of the main street in the town or of its residential neighbourhoods, only individual buildings. We get a trio of memorable characters \u2013 the stoical and obstinate Mildred, the rough diamond Chief Willoughby, and the ball of impotent rage that is Jason Dixon. But some aspects of the character development feel perfunctory and even lazy, in that Mildred, (like most of the supporting characters), is defined by her relationship to the billboards controversy and very little else. For instance, it struck me as odd that Mildred appears to have no outside interests or female friends her own age, and I'm not altogether clear about how she earns a living - she works in some kind of touristy gift ship but it's unclear whether she owns the business or is just employed there. Peter Dinklage is a very good actor but he is given very little to do. James, the character he plays, is rather sad and pathetic and his entire contribution to the story, such as it is, is defined by his dwarfism. In so far as it's a socially-aware film, the treatment of the political issues is muddled and self-contradictory. For example, early on it feebly tries to make a point about police racism, then later it shows they're not racist after all because they can accept a black senior officer's authority without difficulty...Meanwhile the two named black civilian characters don't advance beyond predictable behaviour, in that they are both anti-police. This sort of cynicism and borderline misanthropy may be forgivable if a movie works on the level of pure comedy, but for me - and I am perhaps in a minority here - it simply didn't. I felt the humour was vulgar and unimaginative in the extreme and was overly reliant on violence, anger and profanity. Most of the audience at the sell-out UK premiere laughed audibly throughout - I chuckled maybe four times. There were all kinds of little things that irritated me. Why does Mildred's daughter have Nirvana posters on her wall if it's set in the present day? Why does Mildred have to deliver that rant about pederasty in the Roman Catholic Church, when it has no connection to the rest of the story and when Missouri is mainly Protestant anyway? And do we really need to be told that she was victim of spousal violence in her past marriage, when the film has nothing original or meaningful to say on the subject? What's the point in creating a strong, non-stereotypical female character only to make her a victim of male violence twice over?So, how can I justify five stars? Well, it's an unconventional story with unconventional characters. It subverts the familiar trope of the plucky loner fighting against overwhelming odds, and challenges the idea that protest, non-conformity and anti-authoritarianism are good things in and of themselves. Mildred behaves appallingly but has a completely unshakeable sense of her own righteousness. Perhaps a bit like some of the people who take part in BLM and Antifa protests and use them as an opportunity to start fights and create mayhem. The ending is pleasingly ambiguous; it leaves open the possibility of some kind of redemption for the characters, but at the same time it recognises that Damascene conversions are rare in real life and that many of us only learn from our mistakes as fast as we make new ones.Go to see it expecting a sort of sub-Tarantino celebration of stylised violence and amorality and you won't be disappointed. As film critic James Verniere once wrote in summing up another movie, it's good nasty dirty fun. But the sad thing is it could have been so much more."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" (2017 release; 115 min.) brings the story of Mildred Hayes. As the movie opens, we see her driving by several unused dilapidated billboards near her house. She inquires with the Ebbing Advertising Agency (located across the street from the Police Department), and decides to put up three billboards. Combined, they read: Raped While Dying/And Still No Arrests\"/How Come. Chief Willoughby? We learn that her daughter Angela was murdered 7 months ago, and that no suspects have been identified by the cops. OF course, this public shaming does not sit well with Chief Willoughby, and he decides to pay Mildred a visit (his first since the murder, Mildred remarks). At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Martin McDonagh, who previously gave us \"In Bruges\" and \"Seven Psychopaths\". While those movies were over the top in many ways, here McDonagh goes a more subtle yet still hard-hitting way in looking at how one strong-willed woman upsets the fabric of a little Missouri town and along the way exposes its ugly underbelly. If you have seen the movie's trailer (and it was hard to escape that in recent weeks), one might expect something very similar, at least in style, to McDonagh's earlier movies, rip-roaring from start to finish. But that is not the case at all. Yes, of course there are those moments, but there there are also many other scenes in the movie that are reflective and outright touching. As hard-boiled as Mildred seems to be, the real hurt and grieving she displays on occasion says a lot more about her than when she kicks some school kids in a place where it hurts (yes, she really does). McDonagh brings out wonderful performances, none more so than the one-of-a- kind Frances McDormand as Mildred. McDormand must at this point surely be considered the front-runner for the Best Actress Oscar early next year. But she gets plenty of help, including Sam Rockwell (as the sleazy and racist officer Dixon), and Woody Harrelson (as Chief Willoughby),\"Three Billboards\" premiered this Fall to immediate critical acclaim, which for the most part is well deserved. (I personally felt a bit let down by the movie's concluding 15 min., which of course I will not spoil.) The Thanksgiving early evening screening where I saw this at in Ft. Myers FL, was attended nicely (about 15- 20 people) but nowhere near a sell-out. It will be interesting to see how the movie does at the box office as it gets a wider release in weeks to come. Martin McDonagh is certainly no ordinary writer- director and if you appreciate hiss off-kilter approach, you will welcome his latest. I encourage you to check out \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "If Martin McDonagh wasn't already on your \"great new writers/directors\" list after In Bruges' steady increase in popularity (holy crap, that was nine years ago!? Does \"new\" still apply?), Three Billboards should cement him on it. I think this film will go down as one of the more underrated gems of the year, and slowly gain popularity as time goes on, similar to the aforementioned In Bruges and what I hope for last year's The Nice Guys.The movie is a dark comedy, through and through, and it supplies ample amounts of both. The movie does get heavy, but even in the darkest moments, keeps the audience smiling with the consistent off- beat, biting, witty remarks from its equally colorful characters. I keep bringing it up, but if you've seen In Bruges, you know the drill here. Tonally, Three Billboards is of course similar, but not at all a rehash. There's plenty of new content and characters to digest here.Speaking of the characters, the cast is perfect in this movie. Each of the headliners (McDormand, Harrelson, Rockwell) is three- dimensional, and they all get their share of comedic and dramatic scenes. All three are perfect. This is one of the best acted movies I've seen all year. There were a few points throughout the movie where some particularly abrupt drama/comedy tonal shifts felt a bit awkward, and as a result the intended comedic effect didn't land like it otherwise would have. For the most part, the film (and McDonagh's work as a whole) pulls this off adroitly-and let's be honest, it's a tough tactic to consistently pull off. All in all, the movie will make you sad, it will make you angry, and it will make you laugh, occasionally all at the same time. It also has something genuine to say about the dichotomy of anger and love."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "It takes not only a considerable amount of skill to match deep-dark- heartbreaking dramatic storytelling and characters with a pitch\ud83d\ude28black comic edge; to go the extra mile one should hopefully have a voice. Martin McDonaugh may be mistaken too quickly as having made a Coen brothers film - Frances McDormand being there doesn't help assuage that argument - yet through In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths he's shown his acidic, no bullish*t, I see clich\u00e9s for what they are and raise you a subversion original voice in writing and an assured hand in direction. He also casts his movies like nobody's business and from McDormand down to Sam Rockwell and Sam Rockwell's mom to the actress as Angela Hayes having one scene, he has everyone with fresh, Thanksgiving-buffet-plate meat to chew on. While it's one of the best films of the year, I'm sure if I try, more or less, I can find some nitpick or even flaws - the daughter Hayes scene could be one simply for the final two lines mother and daughter have, I understand the point but it's too far on the nose, especially for this artist; another could be how quickly \"f***head\" Rockwell comes around to a kind-of-sort-of-maybe redemption in the third act - but all of this is overshadowed by the giant moral and social-political-emotional scope of everything else. Mildred Hayes is one of those movie characters that, male or female (but especially make), stays with you for not so much how balls they are but how marvelled they are by their own ballsiness.McDormand has such a command of the character in the big moments - those trailer bits that, if ones been going to the movies this year, has been overplayed (though luckily practically all of the major story points aren't revealed) - one may miss a moment like when Mildred realizes a character did something horrible that she punished someone else for, or how she looks after a tough a-hole comes into her shop coming face to face with a threatening countenance. She's played so many people who carry an ocean of complexity but whats appealing is how she carries a lot of it without needing to show much. Hell, one beat where she has her two animal slippers on their feet talk in bold violent terms is among the great acting moments of the year. So how relevant is it to now? I mention Do the Right Thing because not so much it having the same dramatic build up so much as it has a similar anger - no sorry not true, boiling, scornful rage - at how segments of our country have been, are and may always be (the mother of Rockwell is one such character who inspires such rage at least for me, and she is just your average white-bread matriarch. Also like Lee's film it shows a community who are inextricably linked, and at times the stark racism is almost like a bad joke (Rockwell's cop being a torturer of black inmates, if not more than one, is almost a goof; he's akin to the John Tururro type in DtRT, a man who just is what he is and it's too late to change now, so everyone looks at Mildred in this story and her whole billboards \"thing\" closer to something like a basic acting-out in grief than a howl for justice. And then when it comes time for a new man to come in to the town's police force, and I won't say how or why, and id rather you just see it than me put in the spoiler marker, it is like a cold bath of irony: the genuinely tough, decent, on top of it older black man. This is as towering a script as we may get in American cinema this year, and if it has imperfections it shouldn't matter much. The central idea here is such: if you don't bring a light on stark injustice, people wont do much if nothing else because it's not on their mind or (frankly) in their own interests. Willoughby says at one point the billboards are a \"chess move.\" What is the \"king\" to take then? The ending of the film may seem to leave things too open-ended for some, and I get that. To me, the end is that there's never an ending when it comes to looking at rape (which is assault) and other violence (which is more directly assault) there is no clear ending. You can kill yourself, sure, but that doesn't solve much for those who have to live in total pain. I love this!"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "I give this movie a 10 rating because it is a must see for anyone who wants a primer on intellectual bigotry.The writer would have been able to develop a more powerful story if he had actually spent some time in the town that gave him the idea for the movie instead of just blowing through it at 70 miles per hour in a cross country bus.The small town characters in this movie are unrealistically portrayed as a foul-mouthed, violent, unkind pack of wolves so far from reality they are barely unrecognizable as human beings.Calling this a dark comedy seems to be the get out of jail free card for creating a story that panders more to the intellectual elitist perception of middle America than to bridging the divide with it.Please do see this movie and judge from your reaction how far up the intellectual bigotry scale you are and next time the people responsible for this movie want to make a dark comedy, they might want to try turning the camera on themselves."}]
