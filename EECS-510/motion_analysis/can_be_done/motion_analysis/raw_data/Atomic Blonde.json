As excited as I was to see this from the fast paced and well edited trailer, I left the theater disappointed and expecting more.Good: Charlize Theron and James McAvoy were great in this film and worked well with the role given. The movie has a vibrant and appealing rock star style with bright neon colors. Bad: The action sequences lacked innovative and new stunts and were not entertaining at all except a one-shot staircase scene. The story and plot of the movie were not interesting or intriguing. Also the movie seemed to jump all over the place going from one setting to the next. Also the addition of Sofia Boutella was not used effectively. A lack of comedic moments.Overall: This movie was a let down and a movie that I prefer more is John Wick which understands what it is and entertains the audience. As great as the cast was, the plot and action sequences lacked creativity and stylistic moments.2.7/5"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "OK, so I'm over in Cine Europe and just seen this movie. It's awesome. I'm a dude who simply put, likes a good action movie. Whilst this film is not an all time classic (hence the 9 rather than 10) or about to win an Oscar for the most heart felt 'put me to sleep' sort of movie; it excels in every other way. The action was non stop and simply brutal at times; on a few occasions throughout this movie I said the word 'ouch'... Charlize truly kicked butt in this film (And her performance truly surprised me). I also loved the cinematography - it has a different feel to everything else out there but in a really refreshing way.So, if you're kind of person who could easily watch John Wick and would find the idea of watching la la land etc = death; watch this film!!!"}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "\"Atomic Blonde\" is based on a graphic novel and in \"Atomic Blonde\" MI6 agent Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) is sent on a mission with her contact David Percival (James McAvoy) in Berlin to recover a list of double agents that are defecting to West Berlin during the height of the Cold War. I'm gonna cut right to the chase. The performances in this film are really good. Ever since \"Mad Max: Fury Road,\" I have been on the Charlize train. Everything before that was really hit or miss with me for her, but she has really come into her own and delivers a great performance. She looks physically fit, she nails the British accent, and conveys emotions very well. James McAvoy does not need to be talked about. He is a great actor and delivers yet another great performance. One that surprised me was Sofia Boutella. I have been wanting to see what she is capable of ever since I saw her in \"Kingsman,\" and everything she has been in she has impressed me, and this is not different. Her role in this is a little smaller than her previous roles, but even if she isn't amazing or great, she's still fine and I enjoy watching her performances. The action sequences in this film are really great as well. They are violent, they are brutal, they are bloody. Watching them is almost like watching a bare-knuckled boxing match, with one boxer having brass knuckles to knock the other one out. The scenes are choreographed very well, which makes sense since the director used to be a stunt coordinator, and the stunts that result are really cool. One thing that impressed me with the action sequences was the very minimal to no use of a musical score. I'm not sure if that was on purpose. To me, it added a sense of realism to the scenes. There is also an action scene towards the end of the film that is filmed to look like one take, and it is noticeable right away, but halfway through the scene you are just in awe that the camera hasn't cut back to anything else yet. The camera-work in this scene is top notch, and throughout the entire movie for that matter, and when this scene reaches the halfway point to see just how this one take is shot and what exactly is being shot. It is a really impressive scene and I would say that this scene lasts for about seven to eight minutes. You almost believe that the camera isn't going to cut to anything for the rest of the movie. The rest of the camera-work is spot on throughout the rest of the movie. What made me happy was that there was no \"shady cam\" in these action sequences. This is a far superior story than I was expecting. The tone of the movie is very dark and brutal, and the movie conveys perfectly. There is almost no humor in the film, and I think if that were added it would have felt out of place. The story really suit the tone the director was going for and was enjoyable enough. I really like the way the story is conveyed in this film, told as a flashback narrative, which added a deeper layer of storytelling to the movie. However, that story feels very unoriginal. This is a plot I've seen done to death so many times already. The story also tries to do too much towards the end. It throws plot twist after plot twist at you and I didn't buy any of it. It became too predictable towards the end. You knew who was gonna be who, and when people in the theater are turning to the person next to them saying \"see I told you,\" that's a problem. And is just me or is the editing in some scenes really shotty? It could be because I saw this at a press screening a month before release and the creative team is still working on technical issues but there were two or three scenes where technical issues sprung up, one of which was noticeable. This scene involves characters talking but their lips aren't moving. Was ADR edited into the movie? It seemed a bit odd to me. And when we see characters talking and they are shot from the side, you can tell that their lips aren't moving. The characters in this movie feel very non-existent. They are not fleshed out at all. I could not tell you a damn thing about any of these characters other than the fact that they are spies. Despite some narrative flaws and technical issues, \"Atomic Blonde\" was still an enjoyable enough movie. The action, performances, camera-work, directing, violence all really worked. I feel like this is a film that audiences and critics will be divided on. I am going to give \"Atomic Blonde\" a B.Check out my video review of \"Atomic Blonde\" here on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4oNmIqEMes"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "What stands out most about Atomic Blonde is just how well made it is. The technical aspects are far above average for a simple action movie. The cinematography is beautiful. There is great use of rule of thirds, creating gorgeous on screen compilations. The editing works hand-in-hand with this, making for really spectacular transitions that only enhance the overall film. David Leitch does a brilliant job directing. Just in terms of the style and the atmosphere of the movie, he really nails a strong position, and never lets go of it. This world that's created feels like the real world, and yet it also feels enhanced and ultra-real, which just makes it all the more interesting to watch. The soundtrack and the score really worked in tandem with all the other visual elements in order to really draw out the atmosphere, and to make it this pulsing and vibrating world of darkness and bad-assery. Also under Leitch's jurisdiction were the performances. The cast across the board was really good, but Charlize Theron and James McAvoy really stood out. Theron obviously plays the cold, calculating bad-ass, while McAvoy goes for the more psychotic, manic killer. They play well off of each other, each with their own clear and distinct personalities. Toby Jones and John Goodman were also good in their roles, but their characters' screen times were so minimal that really anyone could have played them. There was no true shining moment for either of these actors in terms of their performances, just due to the lacking nature of their characters. But this was ultimately fine, as it meant we got more screen time with Theron and McAvoy..."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Charlize Theron stars as Lorraine Broughton, an MI6 agent stationed in Berlin as the wall is about to fall in \"Atomic Blonde.\" This white-knuckle spy movie brings the action, and we would expect nothing less given that it is from the director of \"John Wick.\" The film's action scenes are intense and brutal, and are staged expertly. A (filmed as to appear to be) one-take, several-minute-long scene involving Theron fighting on a stairway is choreographed particularly impressively. This scene occurs about 80 percent of the way into the movie. Theron does a very fine job playing the gritty, sometimes tired Broughton--and also manages to make her stunts look easy in the process. The film's aesthetic qualities are stylish, as is the unique and nourish depiction of Berlin in 1989. The soundtrack--an eclectic ensemble of 80's rock and pop--is great as well.While \"Atomic Blonde\" has plenty of strengths, the film does contain a few structural flaws. The film seems to have a bit of a pacing problem. For example, the film takes time to get going (despite never feeling tedious,) which is fine until one realizes that the last act of the film is almost shockingly overstuffed. After the well-shot stairway action scene, viewers have plot twist after plot twist thrown at them almost relentlessly for the last twenty or so minutes of the film. This is a bit of a problem because these plot 'twists' start feeling quite rushed. Additionally, the plot as a whole is rather predictable, and character development could have been improved.At the end of the day, though, audiences will most likely be thrilled by the visceral action on display in this film--while also managing to sing (or hum) along to its soundtrack and take in Charlize Theron's strong performance in the lead role. While they will recognize that the story and structure of the film is imperfect, they likely will forgive the movie for much of that given the high entertainment quotient. Recommended. 7/10"}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "I always felt that Charlize Theron had a powerful presence on screen after seeing her as the villain in Snow White and The Huntsman. Her dominance was undeniable in her eyes, and when I found she would be in Atomic Blonde directed by one of the directors of the first John Wick movie, I walked in with excitement for a thrilling ride.Charlize plays a spy stationed in Berlin days before the Berlin Wall is torn down to find who is searching for the murderer of a close co-worker after searching for a MI6 list of secret agents. As she steps into Berlin, she realizes her trust becomes minimal and has to be prepared to defend herself at every given moment.David Leitch's direction feels very similar to John Wick in visual style using neon lights and smoother camera movement to feel the impact of every hit each character lays on another even to the point of showing even the strongest fighters get exhausted in battle, and in many cases, makes their own wounds worse which is a great and fun detail to the fights. The film never takes itself too seriously either as most of the fights are placed in between 1980s synth pop and even George Michael music.There is a fight in a hallway which is presented as a single take, and it's as AMAZING as people have made it seem and is worth the price of admission. The moment goes on for about 10 minutes, but it feels the film around it was tailor made for this moment.However, the rest of the film doesn't have that grip even in the downtime when action isn't happening. There are times when the film is explaining the plot, and since the script lacks sharpness, it feels like it's a blur to keep up with what exactly is happening and who to be aware of for the protagonist's sake.If you are a fan of John Wick or just hard hitting action movies, Atomic Blonde will absolutely spark your excitement. It just hurts that the plot surrounding is when the film fizzles before it hits the fuse."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "This has to be the best sound track of all time! Charlize Theron lights the screen on fire! I am so glad she gave so much to this project. I yelled at the screen and pumped my fist several times during this action packed explosion. Theron proves once again that she is a force to be reckoned with in this character. I would say this is the best she has ever looked but Theron has proved time and time again to be one of the most talented and gorgeous women in the world. Her character has so much depth to it. U will never expect or guess the ending! I love the Costumes they put her in and Art Direction. Where and how did they get these locations? Great Job and I hope this turns into a franchise."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "Atomic Blonde pits an elusive and brutal MI-6 agent, Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) against hit men, secret agents, dual agents, thug after thug and (very briefly) James McAvoy. Directed by John Wick's David Leitch, Atomic Blonde is just what you would expect out of a close-to-August release. It is bland storytelling mixed with truly impressive action sequences. When the chips are down, it makes for a VERY frustrating film. While the film is supposed to be somewhat of a period piece with taking place during the Cold War, it adopts the flaws of a handful of 80s and 90s action films in the worst ways possible. It is dull and tries to make sense of itself. Instead of embracing what could be a fun corny romp, Atomic Blonde tries being as realistic as possible despite never really challenging the characters. We never feel like they're in real danger. We never feel like there is anything at stake outside of a mysterious dossier and it translates to a pretty flat film. Leitch abandons what made John Wick so fun and it quickly turns to a drab and dull experience just after the opening sequence. With that being said, despite the film being more of the same, it still features some incredibly impressive choreography in its fight sequences. Leitch is known for impressive stunt work and it doesn't change here. You just get to thinking: had Leitch dedicated the same high standard to the story that he did for the stunts, we'd probably have a better film.The film, however, is not all bad. The cast is exceptional. Charlize Theron and James McAvoy are incredible together. Theron's determination to deliver a strong female character is abundantly clear and it pays off. Lorraine is such a great character for Theron and allows her to continue to deliver strong women on screen. Despite the story being weak in its knees, the characters are strong and the performances are even stronger especially Theron. Overall, Atomic Blonde is a let down when considering the talent behind the camera. While Leitch hits nowhere near the mark that John Wick hit, he still hits in certain spots by delivering awesome action and a strong character."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "The name of the film was not enough deterrent to go and watch Atomic Blonde which was brought for an early screening at the cinematheque in my village one day after its world premiere in London. I have no regrets about deciding to go and see it, as the film is much more than the name says, and by far exceeds the level of most of the comics-inspired movies (not that there is something wrong with them, its just that too many of them are childish). It actually may be one of the best action entertainment films of this summer, with a story complex enough and interesting enough to draw the attention, and excellent execution on all that relates to the action parts of the film.The dark and violent spy story in Atomic Blonde takes place in the last few weeks and days of divided Berlin. The Wall is going to fall, and the epoch of the games of lies and treason fights between the secret services of the powers on one side or the other of it is speeding up to the point of losing control. Last minute accounts are violently settled and everybody prepares for the day after. A list of the active agents has the value and power of an atomic weapon. In order to get hold of it, the British MI6 agency sends the feminine equivalent of James Bond - the super-spy and super-killer Lorraine Broughton played by Charlize Theron. She is ten times as deadly as any of her male competitors and is a master of double or multiple spying games. Success is by no means ensured however and the road to it is paved with uncountable numbers of corpses.The director of the movie is David Leitch, actually a first timer in film directing, but a master of stunts with more than 80 films on record. No wonder than that the fights in the film are superbly directed. I have not seen better since The Matrix. Leitch succeeds however much more - he builds a violent but credible story that shows the world of the classical John le Carre novels falling down together with the Wall in a Big Bang. No need to say, Charlize Theron is fit to the task, and calling her the feminist answer to all the misogynist action movies we have seen in the last 100 years is no exaggeration. Unless you really detest violent action movies, you should like this film."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "When I first saw the trailer for this film, I was disappointed. It just seemed like another spy movie with a great cast, but nothing unique. I was extremely wrong. I was completely unaware of how stylized this film would be, but man was I surprised; in a great way. The film is set in the 80s, and so the whole film is stylized as so. The least I could say is - it's damn beautiful. From the neon to the soundtrack, it's an experience. One that shall not be forgotten. Oh, and by the way, the fight scenes? They're incredible. I will say that I couldn't quite tell what the plot was during the first 20-25 minutes, but it was eventually resolved, and I had a fantastic experience viewing this film."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "\"Atomic Blonde\", or as it may come to be known as \"Bisexual Wonder Woman\", is a pretty good bookend to a lot of the bigger action movies this summer. Again we have some stellar action sequences accompanied with an awesome soundtrack. Charlize Theron plays an MI-6 agent sent to Berlin on the eve of the fall of the Berlin Wall to work with the Station Chief (James McAvoy) there to figure out who killed one of their own and recover a list of undercover agents. This is the action film Theron deserves. A fantastic action actress in \"Mad Max: Fury Road\", she again shows there are few situations where she doesn't seem like one cool customer totally in charge and living by her own rules. She's like a female James Bond combined with the physicality of a Jason Bourne combined with one of those French chicks from \"Blue is the Warmest Color\" because she goes lesbian on Sofia Boutella in a couple scenes here. But yeah, the movie was directed by David Leitch, who was one half of the directing team behind \"John Wick.\" He's also directing the sequel to Deadpool, which I like because you can see a director whose good at adding levity to dark tones. The backdrop here is pretty clear and sets the mood perfectly. Basically Berlin in the 80's is a cold hell hole, accompanied by neon interior bars and dark alleys and some ugly dark green lighting thrown in there too. It's a perfect place for a spy thriller and Leitch does an admirable job of making sure things stay dark while throwing in some comic moments, a lot of which come from the musical choices themselves. Another summer flick with a great soundtrack guys.There's nothing better than when he and Theron join forces though. The gun battles and fights are incredible; the things she does with an extension cord or the heel of her shoe are awesome. Leitch for the most part stays away from camera tricks and instead opts for tracking shots that perfectly keep focus on the action. He succumbs to slo-mo in the end fight but up until then, there's really no one better at filming fights than the \"John Wick\" guys. About the only thing wrong with the movie other than slo-mo is the plotting. The clich\u00e9 of recovering an agent list didn't really bother me but what did is that there seems like a lot going on with the wall coming down, side characters, and whose setting up who and for what reason. Don't go in expecting to follow much. But the stars here are Theron and Leitch, who together are nothing short of dynamic and exhilarating. The rest of the cast, which has Toby Jones and John Goodman in addition to McAvoy, are fine but pale in comparison. This is just a cool action flick. So I go 7 out of 10.

Atomic Blonde (based off the graphic novel The Coldest City) excels in near precision visual style and complicated yet understandable plot dynamics. Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) is an MI agent sent to Berlin at the turn of the Berlin Wall being brought down. Her mission is to find a list being sold to Russia with every secret agent name and... to possibly find the double agent looking to sell it. Her mission leads her to David Percival (James McAvoy), another MI agent who has settled into the deep underworld of the 80's Berlin scene. Broughton quickly get wrapped up in the Russia/Berlin conflict while battling another possible double agent looking to sell her out.Theron is amazing. Her gum shoe noir style is compellingly cool and brilliantly balanced with sudden sparks of non-stop action. The long take fight scenes are painstakingly real to the point where as a viewer you are exhausted for the characters. The third act is near constant action with camera angles and tracking shots that take a page out of Children of Men. To compare the fight scenes to John Wick would be apt but Atomic Blonde is not a carbon copy of John Wick but an expansion.McAvoy is exceptionally charming, smart and charged. He's created a character, in a world where all characters can't be trusted, that bends the line of whether the viewer can love or hate him. He's devilishly good.The soundtrack is another character within the film and provides both a contextual background (1980's Berlin) and complements the already overpowering (in all the bests ways) visual style. Atomic Blonde managed to take all the best songs of the 80's and seamlessly upgrade them to both a new generation while also invigorating the old.While the plot can be hard to follow and complicated a la Tinker Tailor Solider Spy, but it all cleans up nicely and by the third act, you can sit back and enjoy riveting non stop action. If you ever ask yourself while watching, \"Am I going to understand this?\" You will. Sit tight and know the plot works itself out.The wonderfully stylized visuals, sleek nostalgic soundtrack and brilliant acting make Atomic Blonde one of the best films of the summer 2017 season and continues the trend for mid-budget, dark action flicks."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "The 80's neon style, glam and decor are pretty cool in contrast to East Berlin, but the soundtrack incorporation is what really stands out.

I can also listen to Kaleida's downtempo 99 Luftballons on repeat, so thank you to the movie for that.Then there is the fight choreography and fight cinematography; perfect. No hard to comprehend shaky cam masking a lack of actor skills or composition.

Apparently, Leitch hired Johnathan Sela again. Probably the crappiest cinematographer working in Hollywood today. The script is awful as same goes to the original source material. It's derivative, contrived, boring, and predictable. I cannot believe Fox would hired such a crappy director. John Wick 1 and 2 were already awful enough and they go and hire this guy. I don't understand. Now Johnathan Sela is the cinematographer for Deadpool 2. So, brace yourselves. Deadpool 2 will be a total piece of trash and will look like one as well.

In you've seen any episode of MacGyver or any spy movie set in the 70s/80s Cold War era, you know the deal.Good: The action in this film is incredible. The fight scenes are shot cleanly choreographed well. It doesn't do that Paul Greengrass bulls*** where the camera is shaking like an ex-gridiron player with CTE and it doesn't cut every 1.2 seconds to hide shoddy stuntmanship. The music is pretty rad.The clothes are fantastic.The Bad: Ironically, one of the bad things about this movie was also one of the good. Without getting into spoilers there is one specific fight scene in this film where the music cuts, and its presented as a \"one GIANT take\" with no cuts, which is fine, but I feel that someone saw Daredevil on Netflix, and basically lifted it shot for shot, because it's virtually the SAME EXACT THING.For a film of this ilk, it also tries to get a bit too clever for its own good, tossing in a couple of cheap \"switcharoos\" at the end that left me feeling a bit wonky.Over all this was still supercool and you should see it."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Although I often use this phrase as a pejorative, don't let my headline fool you. Atomic Blonde's story may be lackluster, but it makes up for it in many other ways.If you're going to see this movie, make sure it's for the right reasons. If you want a deep or intriguing narrative, you won't find it here. The story falls flat and the dialogue doesn't have much going for it, however its got just enough kick to string you along to every action sequence. Though, not as much kick as Theron. In Atomic Blonde, Charlize Theron's cool-toned beauty is striking and her fists strike even harder. The fight scenes are impressively choreographed and very easy to follow. David Leitch doesn't throw in any unnecessary shaky cam shots or confusing jump cuts. Instead, you're right there in the action so you can feel the grit and impact behind each punch.The visuals can be described as a cross between The Neon Demon and Blade Runner. The neon aesthetic is both stunning and icy cold. Nothing in this movie feels warm, not even the flame that emanates from lighters or cigarettes, which you'll see a lot of. Another interesting visual choice is how Theron is always wearing black and white. I appreciate that her style felt unique yet consistent throughout the whole film. Another movie that Atomic Blonde draws clear inspiration from is Luc Besson's La Femme Nikita. Without spoilers, Leitch also seems to be a fan of Andrei Tarkovsky. I can't review this movie without mentioning the soundtrack. It's all 80's music which I'm a huge fan of. David Bowie, A Flock of Seagulls, New Order and Depeche Mode. They're all present. Between this and Kenau, I have to say I'm a big of movies using George Michael's Father Figure for shootouts.To wrap things up, the best comparison I can make is that Atomic Blonde is very much like a music video. Specifically a Michael Jackson or Duran Duran music video. You get a sufficient, simple story which could be told over the course of a music video's length, but at the end of the day you probably came for the killer visuals and sound, which Atomic Blonde delivers on.

However, if John Wick is a perfect solo violin performance, Atomic Blonde is that solo violin with a perfect concerto on top.Seriously, aside from the obviously great action scenes, which just goes to show how it's done in terms of quality over cheap thrills, Atomic Blonde improves the one thing that holds John Wick back: its plot.Let's face it: for all of John Wick's technical greatness, the plot was a little shallow at times. Not so for Atomic Blonde, which populates the screen with rich and layered characters even beyond Charlize Theron and James McAvoy's awesome performances. I would single out Sofia Boutella, who if you were let down by her turn as the latest Mummy, will be genuinely surprised at how compelling she can be as an actress.The plot, in short, revolves around spy craft in Cold War Berlin, with the events framed in the week before the Berlin Wall was opened. A crucial bit of information has fallen into unwanted hands, information that would be devastating if it got out, and Theron's character Lorraine is sent in to retrieve it by any means necessary.However, not all is as it seems, and that is as far as this summary will go, because the previews for Atomic Blonde gave very little indication as to what direction the plot would go, instead banking on the awesome action scenes. I'll admit, I went into this expecting somewhat shallow plot but great action, and I was better off for it and you will be too.Seriously, AVOID SPOILERS before seeing this film, you will be rewarded.If there are any faults to this film, I would have to point to the soundtrack, for while it is a great collection of '80s era songs, it almost goes into Suicide Squad-levels of overboard, at one point a new song is played every couple of minutes.

The film is interspersed with neon-lit sequences which reinforces the purpose of this film. The music that accompanies this film will remind you of the underground music scene in the 1980s when people were experimenting to come up with revolutionary melodies.Charlize Theron is perhaps one of the most fashionable spies I've seen on the big screen in recent times. She looks so ethereally pretty and when she exhibits aggression like she did in this film and also in the latest Mad Max film, she looks even more beautiful.

And this is a moment when acting skills should be using. However, in Atomic Blond main character ('Atomic Blonde'\\Lorraine) always wears pocker face. We are talking about Oscar winner C. Theron! I don't know maybe she was acting like this according to scenario or narrations from Director. Her previous role where she played strong female queen Furiosa (Mad Max:Fury Road) and that was really amazing, powerful, charismatic, and deep personage. In 'Atomic' she is only strong and confident, and that all! Truly, J.McAvoy (UK spy\\ 'Percival') character is way much more charismatic, interesting and emotionally deeper then 'Blonde'. Once again, maybe this way of acting from James and Charlize, were requirements from director \u0085 We have also additional characters, like J. Goodman, T. Jones, E. Marsann, S. Boutella and some guys who portray stupid Commies KGB agents (like always Hollywood does). From these persons, 3 persons has about 15 min on screen, from these three only 2 give you some important information regarding all aspects of story, from these 2 only 1 has direct connection with Charlize Theron character, another one has only physical connection (guess who :) ). There is 2 antagonists in movies, KGB agents and double spy agent, whose identity is very interesting for UK and French side only. About Commies as a villains, they are absolutely stupid and useless in shooting, like Storm troopers against Jedi's. All explanation above will cost 5\\10, where 5 \u2013 is only because of Hollywood names. Stunt job. Here is where David Leitch can beat some asses. And he beat them using amazing C. Theron. What did Ms Theron is very very impressive and everyone should applause her. And each stunt person did a great work during this project. In John Wick most of action scenes from Keanu Reeves was based on 'gun fight' sometimes with using hand2had fights, in 'Atomic blonde' everything is reverse. But, in the same time here is difference between John and Blond. First personage was beaten and sometimes crawling saving his live, female character win all fights, and even after 100 kilo man throw her twice at the floor she can beat him (without breaking any of her bones) and in few minutes later take a deep breath and swim 50m underwater in cold water. What I mean, if David Leitch want to bring some realism and brutality in his movie fights scenes, he shouldn't make his main character - unbeaten. That is why -9\\10Cinematography is very important and very different during film. 3\\4 part of movie use short shots for scenes, in the last quarter, when we saw adrenaline action scenes one by one - cinematography takes a long shots.Production Design, Music, Costumes are awesome you feel yourself back at end of 80 s. Overall, without no more comments and no more explanation. 7.5\\10"}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "Brilliantly styled, great acting but an unnecessarily convoluted and confusing plot that leads nowhere. Charlize Theron stars as Lorraine Broughton an agent working for the MI6 as she attempts to recover some list while other people also come after this list but you don't know who's behind who and who actually works for whom and just why exactly all of this is happening as the film tries to create an overly complex story. Charlize Theron's performance itself was really good and the film captured a great atmosphere and had a style that clashes the dark and shadow with splashes of neon lights and colours. In fact across the board there was great visuals and acting from, Charlize, James McAvoy and Sofia Boutella. The fight scenes were choreographed brilliantly, they were gritty relentless and absolutely kick ass however this film unlike John Wick as I have thought it would be like is a lot more of a spy film then an action jam packed fighting streak. Though when there is action Atomic Blonde certainly nails it. So, the character of Lorraine was certainly intriguing and I was indeed curious and interested in finding out just who she is and who the characters are associated with but in the end it seems that all of these questions are unanswered and it just seems that there is a complete lack of motivation on the part of the many parties involved which is a result of trying to be 'too smart for its own good' and to use an extremely messy and unorthodox way of storytelling. Atomic Blonde could've been a great stylistic action film like John Wick so long as it drops its choice of presenting the timeline of the film and its choice to involve so many damn double crossings! Just spend some time developing the characters and their motivations and why exactly everyone is after this 'list'. There is a great film buried in here and I did enjoy certain parts for what it is but the lack of proper narrative and storytelling this film's style and character intrigue can only take it so far."}, {"score": "5/10", "review": "To be honest, I did not expect much of the movie right from the start. But eventually, it even turned out to be more disappointing than I would have ever expected. The story line is rather boring. Also the play of the cast is way below its real potential. Also, I was surprised about the poor German skills of the German characters (e.g. the Stasi spy's German skills were poorer than those of C. Theron). Although I know that for a great part these roles are not played by native German actors. But why didn't Til Schweiger play the role of Merkel or the Stasi spy? In my perspective, C. Theron's acting as well as the music are perhaps the only good things worth pointing out about this movie. It would be unfair to compare this one with the two John Wick movies, especially not John Wick 1."}, {"score": "4/10", "review": "Charlize Theron is the reason I went to see \"Atomic Blonde\".

I will keep it simple: Great movie, a great way to spend some time at the theater, and I encourage you to give it a try. At the very least you will have fun watching it."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "The plot of the action-spy movie \"Atomic Blonde\" (R, 1:55) is set against the historical backdrop of the fall of the Berlin Wall in the fall of 1989, so here's a summary of the historical context: As World War II was ending, distrust between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. grew, along with an intense competition for political, economic and military influence in Europe (and elsewhere), which became known as the Cold War. Part of the post-war agreement between the U.S.S.R. and the other Allies provided for a \"temporary\" division and occupation of Germany as American, British, French and Soviet sectors. The same was done with the capital city of Berlin, which happened to sit in the middle of the Soviet zone.In 1949, the American, British and French areas united to form West Germany and their sectors in the capital became West Berlin. The U.S.S.R. remained in control of its areas and refused to allow the planned reunification with the other zones, thus creating East Germany and East Berlin. Over the years, distinct political, governmental, military, economic and social systems developed in the two parts of the divided Berlin. So many East Berliners preferred the western system that a massive exodus from East to West turned into a logistical and propaganda nightmare for the Soviet and East German governments.In 1961, the East Germans literally cemented the long-closed border between East and West Berlin by constructing a concrete barrier the length of the city, erected guard towers and put in place obstacles, all of which made it nearly impossible for vehicles or people to cross from East to West, except at certain tightly-controlled checkpoints. So, for the 28 years that the Berlin Wall stood, it symbolized the Cold War and the \"Iron Curtain\" that had descended across Europe between the western democracies and the Eastern Bloc countries controlled by the Soviet Union. That is, until 1989, when a series of liberation movements swept eastern Europe, toppling governments and leading to the fall of the Berlin Wall. That moment in history provides the setting for the fictional Cold War cinematic tale \"Atomic Blonde\". Charlize Theron stars as Lorraine Broughton, a skilled and lethal secret agent working for the U.K.'s MI6. Cut, bruised and battered, she sits in an interrogation room at MI6 headquarters being debriefed by her boss (Toby Jones) and his American CIA counterpart (John Goodman). Always calm and collected, while often also being dismissive, secretive and mysterious, Broughton tells the two men (and those standing behind the two-way glass) what happened on her recent mission to Berlin. MI6 sent her to a city about to undergo a political sea change to retrieve a stolen dossier with a list of double agents, a list especially valuable in light of the ongoing transformation of eastern Europe. As important and dangerous as this assignment was to begin with, it became more so (on both counts) but didn't quite go according to plan.Broughton was ordered to work with MI6's Berlin station chief, David Percival (James McAvoy). Percival is eccentric and just as mysterious as Broughton, leading her to believe that he might actually be working against her. After being (temporarily) captured by some bad guys, the first order of business seems to be finding a contact known as Spyglass (Eddie Marsan), who has gotten a hold of The List and is willing to exchange it for safe passage out of East Berlin for him and his family, and maybe a few other perks thrown in for good measure. Of course, just finding Spyglass turns out not to be enough to get this List, especially with all the guys trying to kill Broughton, and a French agent (Sofia Boutella) showing up all over the place\u0085 including in bed with Broughton. Besides being loaded with intrigue and packed with intense fight scenes, this movie has a good bit of nudity and sex (such is the life of a spy) and a soundtrack full of well-chosen 1980s pop tunes (some original and some covers) that entertain and illuminate in this twisty Cold War espionage thriller.\"Atomic Blonde\", like many action movies, isn't going to be remembered so much for its story or its acting as for its boundary- pushing action, but this one raises the bar to a whole new level. Adapting Anthony Johnston's graphic novel \"The Coldest City\", Kurt Johnstad (the \"300\" movies, \"Act of Valor\") gives us a fairly engaging but unremarkable spy tale in which Movie Fans are led to wonder who is working for whom, what is really happening and why, throughout the film and indeed right up to the last scene. But what makes this movie special is the innovative direction of former stuntman and (uncredited) co-director of \"John Wick\", David Leitch. His fight scenes are highly stylized and also more brutal, more realistic and more creatively photographed than in any other action movie I can think of.Theron's line delivery is too understated (Angelina Jolie played a similar character better in \"Salt\"), but she completely throws her body into those action sequences (after having worked out with her \"The Devil's Advocate\" co-star Keanu Reeves, as he was training for \"John Wick 2\"). The combination of Leitch and Theron gives us some of the most exciting fight sequences ever captured on film (especially in the already-legendary stair case scene). Theron's character would give Jason Bourne all he could handle. (And am I the only one who can't help but dream about the cinematic nirvana of Theron's Lorraine Broughton going up against Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow?) \"Atomic Blonde\" is an otherwise forgettable movie with unforgettable fight scenes and is worth a look for those moments alone. \"B+\""}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "\"Atomic Blonde\" (2017 release; 115 min.) brings the story of British super-spy Lorraine. As the movie opens, we are told it's \"Berlin, November, 1989\" (some days before the fall of the Wall). Another spy is hunted down and killed by a KGB spy. We then switch to \"London, 10 Days Later\", and Lorraine is about to be debriefed by her MI6 superior and a guy from the CIA. At that point, things shift to \"The Beginning\", and we learn the full story. AT this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from David Leitch, who co-directed the unexpected box office hit \"John Wick\". Here he takes on a similar type (ultra-violent) movie, but instead with a female lead character. Let's be honest, Charlize Theron TOWERS over this movie. The first shot we see of her is when she rises from an ice-bath she is taking to recover (we're not quite sure of what, at that time), and the shot of her back and arms (also featured in the movie's trailer) is just awesome. And it only gets better from there. Theron claws and kicks and shoots her way out of the most hair-raising binds. She will not be denied! There is a key scene in the middle of the movie where seemingly an army of KGBers are after her, and it just blows you away. Some reviews have referred to Theron \"asserting\" herself as an action star. Did they not see \"Mad Max Fury Road\" in 2015? Theron was so over-powering in her role that she managed to reduce Mad Max as a side kick in his own movie franchise! I was also impressed with Atomic Blonde's production set, as the makers have faithfully recreated Berlin circa 1989 (the movie was filmed in both Budapest and Berlin), down to the last details. Not quite so good is the fact that the script is less than ideal, and also that at no point do we (or at least I) end up caring for any of these characters, and instead we simply stick around for the next over-the-top cartoon-ish (the film is based on a graphic novel) fight scenes. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the outstanding music, both the score by Tyler Bates (of Marilyn Manson) and the many song placements, including the key German hits from the 1980s such as 99 Luftballons, Major Tom (V\u00f6llig Losgel\u00f6st), and Der Kommissar, just to name those.\"Atomic Blonde\" opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely but nowhere near a sell-out. It will be interesting to see how well this plays at the box office. Regardless, if you liked \"John Wick\" or remember Theron from \"Mad Max Fury Road\", I am quite sure that you will like \"Atomic Blonde\", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."}, {"score": "4/10", "review": "If you want to spend half the movie looking at closeups of Charlise Theron's face, this is the film for you. Most of the rest of the film shows you her walking around London, walking about Berlin, walking around the airport, walking up the gang plank, etc. Every so often, but rarely, there is an action sequence that looks pretty staged. If this isn't enough to warn you away, the music is so loud it's a constant irritant."}]
