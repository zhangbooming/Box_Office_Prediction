[{"score": "7/10", "review": "Greetings again from the darkness. The \"right\" choice isn't always obvious. Things get more complicated when even the \"best\" choice isn't clear. Place a young child at the heart of that decision tree, and the result may yield emotional turmoil and an abundance of moral high ground and judgment. Such best intentions are at the core of this latest from director Marc Webb (his first feature since 500 Days of Summer) and writer Tom Flynn.Frank (Chris Evans) is raising his 10 year old child prodigy niece Mary (Mckenna Grace) in low-key small town Florida. The circumstances that brought the two of them together aren't initially known, but are explained in a poignant moment later in the film. Frank has been home-schooling Mary and now believes it's time she transitions to public school for the socialization aspect \u0085 \"try being a kid for once\" he urges. Of course, Mary's teacher Bonnie (Jenny Slate, Obvious Child) immediately realizes Mary is special, and just like that, the wheels of the educational system are in motion to explain to Frank why they know what's best for Mary \u0085 a high-fallutin private school where she can be all she can be.There is a really nice and enjoyable story here of Uncle Frank dedicated to doing what he thinks is best for bright and charming and spirited young Mary, but it all comes crashing down when the bureaucrats, and ultimately Frank's mother (Lindsay Duncan), get involved. When the adults can't agree on the best route for Mary, a courtroom battle ensues. Ms. Duncan gets a witness scene reminiscent of Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men, and her overall performance stands in effective stark contrast to the warm fuzzies of Mr. Evans.The supporting cast contributes nicely, though Octavia Spencer's role as kindly neighbor Roberta is more limited than it should be, and the love connection between Evans and Ms. Slate could have easily been omitted - but she is so pleasant on screen, that we don't mind at all. Glenn Plummer and John Finn are the attorneys who go to war, and Fred the one-eyed cat also gets plenty of screen time. But there is little doubt that the movie really belongs to the effervescent Miss Grace. She nails the back and forth between kid and genius, and we never doubt her sincerity.Child prodigies have been explored through other fine movies such as Little Man Tate, Searching for Bobby Fisher, and Shine, and while this one may run a bit heavier on melodrama, but it's worthy of that group. The best discussions after this movie would revolve around what's best for the child. Should she be deprived of \"higher\" education in order to live within a more \"normal\" social environment? Are any of the adults more interested in their own ego than in what's in the child's best interest? Home school vs public school vs private school is always good for some fireworks, and everyone has their own thoughts. So how do we decide who gets to decide? Does a parent get the final say on their child \u2013 even if their motivations may be in doubt? Should every kid be pushed to their academic \u2013 or artistic \u2013 or athletic \u2013 limits? The questions are many and the answers are complicated. There is a great line in the film that itself is worthy of conversation: \"You got on the bad side of a small-minded person with authority\". Yikes. Even Cat Stevens' great song \"The Wind\" can't soften that."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Gifted is a story with not a lot of surprise elements, but it wins the audience over with its powerful statement, outstanding acting and stunning cinematography. Mainly, Gifted has a very dramatic story line. However, Gifted offers much more then that. Viewers also get a subplot of romance, friendship and strong family values as well as some comedy here and there to keep a dramatic movie light.The plot begins when Mary Adler (Mckenna Grace) starts first grade. She isn't like the other kids in her class. Her teacher, Bonnie (Jenny Slate) soon learns that Mary turns out to be a genius in mathematics. She can easily do equations higher than high school level. Despite her clear giftedness, Mary's uncle, Frank (Chris Evans) refuses to put Maryin a school for gifted children, trying to keep the girl's life normal. Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan), Mary's grandmother insists on making her do mathematics around the clock and training her to be a math prodigy. What follows is a custody battle between the two for Mary.My favorite scene really stands out due to remarkable lighting and camera work. The scene really doesn't contribute to the plot, but the cinematography makes it one of the most excellent in the film. The scene shows Mary riding on Frank's shoulders. Behind them, a giant sunset completely fills the sky. The lighting from the setting sun comes out stunningly dazzling. Even though it doesn't add to the complexity of the story, the scene is very impressive and demonstrates the closeness of the uncle and his niece.One of Gifted's weak points waters down to the story. Even though the film is unique from other stories about genius kids, by focusing on the family values and relationships instead of Mary's exceptional mathematical skills, it still comes out very predictable and rather simple. The main conflict never really feels like a major issue but rather, just a side story. Despite those issues, Gifted still entertains through the acting. All the actors deliver outstanding performances. Mckenna Grace, despite being only 10-years-old, completely steals the show. Never does the acting feel forced and the actors seem to authentically connect with their characters and have a true bond on-screen.There are a few adult references in the film, but nothing too worry about. I recommend this for ages 8 to 18 and give it 4 out of 5 stars because, although the story needs work, the acting and cinematography make Gifted a very entertaining and memorable film.By Gerry O., KIDS FIRST!

At first, she often played caregivers (mostly nurses) during her feature film career, which began in 1996 when she played a nurse in \"A Time to Kill\". But then she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for 2011's \"The Help\" (in which she played a maid). Since her Oscar win, the variety in her movie roles has expanded, but she seems to have gravitated towards a certain kind of cinematic story. She took on roles like the peace-loving Johanna in the \"Divergent\" films, a loving grandmother involved in a child custody battle in \"Black or White\" (2015) and a brilliant and protective NASA supervisor in \"Hidden Figures\" (2016). Then, in 2017, she played God himself (well, HERself) in \"The Shack\" \u2013 and a loving grandmotherly figure on the fringes of a child custody battle in the terrific family-friendly drama \"Gifted\" (PG-13, 1:41).The character to whom the title \"Gifted\" refers is a precocious 7-year-old girl named Mary, played by Mckenna Grace (previously mainly known for her TV roles in \"The Young and the Restless\", \"Once Upon a Time\" and \"Designated Survivor\"). Mary never knew her father (who disappeared from the picture when Mary's mother learned that she was pregnant) and her mother died when Mary was six months old. Mary is being raised by her uncle Frank (Chris Evans) in his modest Florida home, which he pays for by freelancing as a boat repairman. Frank's landlady is an older woman named Roberta (Spencer) who loves Mary like she's her own granddaughter. Good thing. Mary's real grandmother (Frank's mom) is an arrogant and controlling woman who lives in Massachusetts. Which is why Frank lives in Florida.After home-schooling Mary for a while, Frank decides that it's time for Mary to go to school, so he enrolls her in first grade. Frank thinks it's critically important that Mary socialize and make friends with kids her own age. Mary doesn't think she should go to school. Roberta agrees and isn't shy about expressing her concerns to Frank. Roberta knows that Mary is special and is concerned about protecting her from a world which can't understand her. Mary doesn't want to go to school because she knows that she can't relate to kids who aren't on her intellectual level. Also because elementary school is so\u0085 well, elementary. Mary's concerns about school play out very quickly when she hits a boy in the face with a book for bullying a younger child \u2013 and when she gets disgusted with her strict, but caring teacher, Bonnie Stevenson (Jenny Slate) for asking the kids what 3+3 equals, when Mary can do calculus! Ms. Stevenson clearly recognizes Mary's genius in mathematics and the school's principal (Elizabeth Marvel) tells Frank that the school is unable to academically challenge a child like Mary and offers to help get Mary into a very prestigious private school nearby. Frank refuses, insisting that what Mary needs more at this point is to learn to socialize with her peers (chronological peers, if not intellectual ones) and to just \"be a kid\". It's at this point that grandma Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan) shows up on Frank's doorstep. A mathematical genius herself (but surpassed by her late daughter), she tries to convince Frank that his method of raising Mary will rob her of her potential and deprive the world of major contributions that she seems destined to make. When Frank refuses to budge, Evelyn drags him into court for a bitter and very personal custody battle. Roberta and Evelyn become more involved in the lives of Mary and Frank, but it's unlikely they can do much to help Frank sort through his limited options.\"Gifted\" is a wonderful movie, wonderfully executed. Screenwriter Tom Flynn and director Marc Webb give us a sweet and meaningful story of love, family and finding balance in life. It also makes for outstanding drama, with well-constructed twists and multi-layered plot lines. Grace is adorable \u2013 and exceptionally talented, as shown not just by this role, but by the impressive list of screen credits she accumulated by the age of 10! Evans may not be carrying Captain America's shield in this movie, but he's still pretty heroic as the loving but conflicted father figure who desperately wants to do right by his niece. Slate reminds us that she's an excellent actress with more range than most of her fellow SNL alumni. She also has great chemistry with Evans, with whom she had a year-long relationship after making this movie. Duncan plays her pseudo-villain role with depth and Spencer is both fun and heart-warming to watch. The occasional adult language and allusions to sex take a little away from this film's family-friendliness, but \"Gifted\" really is a great gift to Movie Fans. \"A\""}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Marc Webb is developing a nice little career for himself. Gifted has a keen sense of emotional weight, even if it's ultimately a tad melodramatic with some clunky dialogue.By far the best thing about 'Gifted' are the performances. Amidst the soap opera-ish story are the touching performances from Chris Evans and Mckenna Grace. This story only works if these two have great chemistry and you believe in their relationship. Both of them clearly had a blast filming with each other and developed a sweet back and forth. The one detractor being that the dialogue they are given isn't all that effective. Tom Flynn doesn't have a ton of experience working on feature films, and it shows here. As I understand, the screenplay was on one of the Hollywood blacklists, so perhaps he wasn't there on set to tinker with the dialogue as the film was shot. Still, someone switching around some lines every now and then would have been nice.The film always has good intentions, as do all of the characters, and in that way it feels safe. It's a predictable story with enough likable qualities to get by, but it could have probably taken a few more chances here and there. Funny enough, the film is about a young child who's smarter than she should be at 8-years old, and that's kind of similar to the film overall. It's an innocent film that tries to be smarter and more thought provoking than it really has a right to be.However, as I stated before, the film's heart lies with Evans and Grace. Their comradery is undeniable and thus there are quite a few powerful scenes. With all of his outings as Captain America, you don't get to see this side of Chris Evans, so I'm grateful this film gave us that. Webb does a nice job of getting an uncharacteristically emotional turn from Evans, and a funny, touching, and surprising turn from the young Grace. Overall, it's not going to knock anyone's socks off, but it definitely puts a smile on your face and maybe even gets a few tears out of you.+Evans & Grace chemistry+Webb has another hit+Funny & heartwarming-Clunky dialogue & character decisions7.4/10"}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "'GIFTED': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new family drama from director Marc Webb; who also helmed 2009's '500 DAYS OF SUMMER', 2012's 'THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN' and 2014's 'THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2' (all great films in my opinion). It was scripted by Tom Flynn and it stars Chris Evans, Mckenna Grace, Lindsay Duncan, Jenny Slate and Octavia Spencer. The story deals with an aggressive custody battle between the uncle and grandmother of a very gifted 7-year-old girl (who's especially talented with Math skills). It's gotten mostly positive reviews from critics, but it's also slightly underperformed at the Box Office so far. I enjoyed it.Mary Adler (Grace) lives with her Uncle Frank (Evans), in a small Florida town. On her first day of school she impresses her teacher, Bonnie Stevenson (Slate), with her amazing math skills. The school wants to give Mary a scholarship, to a special private school for gifted children like her, as a result of this. Frank thinks it's a bad idea though. Mary's mother, Frank's sister, was also very skilled in math, and she committed suicide (when Mary was a baby) because of the pressures of her unique isolated social life. She told Frank that she just wanted Mary to have a normal childhood, before she passed, and Frank wants to honor his sister's wishes. Frank's mother, Evelyn (Duncan), believes Mary's gifts will be wasted in a normal school though, and she seeks custody of Mary, in the Florida courts, as a result of her stubborn thinking. It's later learned that she also obsessively pressured Mary's mother to pursue her gifts.The film is definitely a little clich\u00e9d, and overly sentimental, but I still really enjoy movies like this anyway. The film is definitely not Oscar material, nor is it as impressive as Webb's other films, but it's still really moving and sometimes involving. The actors are all likable in it, and the characters are also quite lovable (most of them). It's arguably emotionally manipulative, and somewhat forced at times, but it still works regardless. It's good to see Evans starring in more quality films too (besides just Marvel flicks), Slate is always good as well, and the young girl is obviously very talented in it too. It's a good movie for a certain type of audience, others definitely won't be too impressed by it though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/K3Maw4akm_o"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "I knew nothing about this film. Had seen no adds, heard no word of mouth, pretty much nothing. I only found it only after tapping out the local AMC 24 and driving a few extra miles to see something new.The premise was intriguing: What to do with a seven year old mathematical prodigy caught between a cozy, loving household occupied by her doting Uncle Frank and a one-eyed cat named Fred, and a challenging but cold academic world ready to pace her on mental treadmills for the rest of her life.McKenna Grace plays little Mary who's character is at the center of attention whether she likes it or not. Mostly not.Grace's performance does raise a few eye brows as she very convincingly plays a precocious and genius little girl plagued with boredom being surrounded by the dead-weight of average students she has nothing in common with.In fact, Mary's personality is also far developed beyond her peers, exhibiting a sarcastic and jaded sense of humor more on par with a bunch of 40-year olds downing a shot or two after a particularly bad day at work.After Mary's abilities are discovered by her first grade teacher, the inevitable battle for command of her future quickly unfolds.One very powerful supporting role is supplied by Lindsay Duncan who portrays Evelyn the Grandmother. Evelyn is a poised and proper Englishwoman armed with a titanium intellect few would want to challenge. As the legal proceedings unfold, Evelyn verbally fire-bombs the entire court room from the stand without batting an eye in her fight for custody of Mary.Her arguments and assessments are hopelessly air-tight and seamless, leaving Uncle Frank and his lawyer scrambling.Frank just wants Mary to be a little girl. Grandma wants to plug her into The Matrix. Who will win? 'Gifted' is not without it's displays of some original laughs. My favorite was a scene in which little Mary discovers her Uncle Frank is sleeping with her 1st grade teacher, who one morning comes stumbling into the kitchen wearing only a towel.Their reaction to each other is priceless.As to why this production is flying under the radar with virtually no advertising or promotion is baffling.The hour-and-a-half flew by for me and left me with an odd feeling it ended too soon. Aside from that, there was almost nothing wrong with this film, at least not that I could find.Warm, unique and entertaining, 'Gifted' should stay with you for days afterwards.A great family night movie."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "In \"Gifted\" after her taxing first day of main stream school, 7 year- old mathematics prodigy Mary, played by amazing Mckenna Grace, sits on her guardian Uncle Frank, played by gentle Chris Evans, on their beach day near their Florida home. Frank asks Mary about making friends at school. Mary says that she can't make friends with \"idiots\". The older and wiser Frank tells her, \"Your Mother would have wanted you to have compassion.\" Mary's Mother Diane was the brilliant mathematician, who tragically committed suicide after Mary was born. Director Marc Webb's \"Gifted\" is predictable, contrived, and could have been better. I loved that scene with Frank and Mary at the beach which defines the movie. \"Gifted\" is about compassion, love, and seeing people as whole beyond just their gifts. I liked \"Gifted\" a lot. Evans and Grace are touching and beautiful together. They compel and shine within the movie's frailties. Writer Tom Flynn has best intentions; however, some of the plot lines and characters falter. Frank's Mother Evelyn played by dominating Lindsay Duncan is too cold and singular without heart. I don't think she is supposed to be the villain, but she is in the movie. Frank and Mary's kind sage landlord Roberta, played by wonderful Octavia Spencer, is not so much a breathing character, rather a paternal narrative device. This wastes the talents of Spencer. Jenny Slate plays Mary's understanding First Grade Teacher Bonnie, who predictably falls in love with Frank. This creates conflict for Mary and Frank which does not have an entirely authentic feel. However, Evans and Slate's chemistry make this work; because we believe Mary's life is in both of their hearts. Bonnie discovers Mary's genius in math class. She informs Frank, of which he is already aware. Frank was the former Philosophy Professor at Boston University, before leaving to care for his late sister's daughter. Frank works odd jobs repairing boats. He home schooled Mary as much as possible. While the kids in Mary's class are doing simple arithmetic, she is schooling herself in partial differential equations. A bully trips Mary's friend on the bus, destroying his school project. Mary responds punching out the bully. Meeting with the school principal, Frank agrees that what she did was wrong. However, he is very proud that she took a stand for someone weaker. The principal reminds Frank that Mary is gifted and would be better suited at the private school for kids like her. Frank says no. He says that Mary's Mother would have wanted her grow up as a kid, and that she would have \"wanted her to be happy\". He promised Diane. He confesses, \"I would rather you dumb her down, if that makes her a good person.\" \"Gifted\" is eloquently about choice. Frank's estranged Mother Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan) visits from her home in London. She wants charge of Mary to foster her amazing gifts at Harvard. Evelyn is also the former math prodigy, like her daughter Diane and now Mary. The family is gifted. She despises Frank for wasting Mary's gift. Mary's Mom Diane was the brilliant mathematician on the verge of solving the unsolvable Navier-Stokes Expressions. Apparently, Diane's gift was a curse that consumed her, and her driven Mother Evelyn didn't allow young Diane to live life\u2014or fall in love. Frank knows this all too well. In the tragically disheartening scene, Frank and Evelyn have lunch at the beach. Evelyn tells Frank the reason why Mary committed suicide: \"She was weak!\" Sadly Evelyn only saw her daughter's gift and not the whole Diane. She intends to sue Frank for custody of Mary. This is the dramatic family conflict of \"Gifted\". \"Gifted\" intimately embodies love and compassion. At the narrative arc, Frank must forsake Mary. As Frank tearfully leaves Mary screams, \"Don't go Frank!\" Frank profoundly discovers what he has with Mary in the loss. Evans and Grace are moving and authentic in their partnership. In the wondrous sunset scene on their beach day, Mary literally climbs on Frank. She asks \"Is there a God?\" Frank answers, \"I don't know\u0085\" Mary asks, \"What about Jesus?\" Frank answers, \"Love that guy\u0085 One way or another we all end up together in the end.\" In \"Gifted\" we are all together in the end. In the closing scenes we watch Grace smiling and being a little girl with her Girl Scout friends in the park. The choices matter. Kids should be allowed to be kids\u2014it's only right. In the end, \"Gifted\" brings us all together."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "With better writing and a more focused plot line, this could've been a great movie.

Actually, that's not really the story \u2013 that's what it should've been. Instead, it's a sloppy courtroom custody battle with a pointless romantic subplot that feels like something you'd see on a lesser episode of Suits. There are some interesting moments in the courtroom scenes, but they feel somewhat out of place in what should be a more character-driven story.The execution suffers most in the third act, in which new characters are introduced on a whim and the movie further loses sight of its central premise. This movie does know what message it wants to deliver, but it gets way too caught up in the specific motivations of each character. I can't really say any more without spoiling, but I will say that the ending, given the problems that are set up earlier in the film, was less than satisfying for me.If you really love child prodigy movies, this one might be worth an iTunes rental a month from now.

However, her late mother's brother, Frank, is determined to give her a normal life like every other kid. However there is as much he can hide from the world, especially her school. Eventually, it turns into a courtroom battle of Mary's custody between Frank and his mother, Mary's grandmother, Evelyn, who wants to have her in top schools for gifted in the country and solve some of the all time great problems in mathematics. In the midst of all this, there is a secret kept safe around Mary's mother's death. While the plot isn't so powerful, the script was very well written which is why the movie was gripping and managed to keep audience's attention. I loved the character sketch of Mary and Evelyn in particular - very assertive, except that Mary had more subtlety instead of visible aggression. Acting (9/10): Chris Evans is great in the role of Frank. His brilliant chemistry with Mckenna Grace is perhaps the reason the movie was so enjoyable. Mckenna Grace had definitely tough role playing a gifted child with all the jargons. However, the raw naughtiness she was able to project just normal to any child of her age brought a lot of life to her role. Lindsay Duncan was good too - reminded me of Leonard's mother from BBT. This was only the second movie of Octavia Spencer I've watched and she was good again even in a limited role. She made her presence felt strongly in the movie even with two other leading ladies more closely related to the protagonists. Overall, the movie had some very good performances to watch out for.

It stars Chris Evans (\"Captain America\"), Mckenna Grace (\"The Young and the Restless\"), Lindsay Duncan (\"Birdman\"), Jenny Slate (\"Obvious Child\"), and Octavia Spencer (\"Hidden Figures\"). Filming began October 2015, largely in Savannah and Tybee Island, Georgia.

It runs at 1 hour; 41 minutes (101 minutes total) and is grouped as PG-13 for some swearing and sexual situations. Now to my review:7 year old Mary (Mckenna Grace) has been spending the prime of her childhood with her Uncle Frank (Chris Evans). However, with first grade beginning, Frank decides that enrolling her in public school will ultimately be beneficial. It is made clear from the beginning scenes that socially, Mary is severely lacking and of course, Frank and his landlady/best friend/babysitter Roberta (Octavia Spencer) are painfully aware of this. Thus, Mary is understandably frustrated by the curriculum and ignorance of her grade level. There, she meets her teacher Bonnie (Jenny Slate) who, after questioning Mary, discovers that she is in fact, gifted. After some googling on both Frank and Mary, Bonnie learns that Mary's mother, Diane, was a brilliant mathematician who ended up committing suicide shortly after Mary's birth. Enter Frank's mother and Mary's grandmother Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan), an equally brilliant and intellectual mathematician, who brings a conflicted antagonist that this movie was undeniably in need of. Evelyn and Frank indulge in some predictable skirmishes over Mary's future, and whether an education that matches her intellect is what she is in need of. Since the two are in such disagreement over the girl's future, Evelyn begins a crusade for full custody. Evelyn and Frank duke it out over Mary in a series of nail-biting court battles (That was sarcasm); Mary, Roberta, and Frank stop at a hospital to watch families' excitement over newborns (eye-roller); and Bonnie and Frank begin romantic entanglements (annoying and unnecessary). + Grace and Evans have wonderful and undeniable chemistry.+ The acting is beautifully executed; the casting is superb. + It raises important arguments over the future and childhood of gifted children. + All of the characters (even the child genius) are relatable and easy to admire. + Evelyn makes a layered and complex antagonist.

I would say it's suitable for kids to watch, although there are some adult themes. Nothing graphic though. It's a quiet movie, not something flashy, not hugely dramatic. But there is a good story that's well filmed and acted -- and honestly, there don't seem to be many of those anymore.All I can say is, watch it and make up your own mind. And yes, I would definitely watch it again."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "I fell in love with the brilliant, unspoken way the difference between being a father and being a dad was explained. It broke my heart to see how much ambition can ruin a person. It broke my heart even more to see the extent to which children could grudge against their mother no matter the cost. The story was beautifully told, and the performances were on point. There were things that could have been done differently, causing less pain for everyone, which is why I didn't find it in me to give it 10 stars, although it's entirely possible that they were meant as a point in case for how humans err. 100% recommended to any drama aficionado."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Gifted is the newest film by Mark Webb and sees to a return to form of his earlier hits like \"500 days of summer\", after the Amazing Spider man franchise's finish we finally get a Mark Webb film that puts him in a position where he is truly comfortable in; Like \"500 days of summer\", \"Gifted\" takes its time and Mark Webb has a thing with patient filmmaking. Along with the brilliant performance by Chris Evans and child actress: McKenna Grace this experience has been an enjoyable one. As I said this film really takes its time developing these characters and the two leads had great chemistry; The dialogue between the leads are both comedic and thoughtful. Even though there are no true climactic moments or 'explosive moments' where the story really rockets off, it manages to be a very subtle and 'normal' movie, perhaps to reflect the central theme of the film in which this child prodigy attempts to live a normal life despite her uniqueness. In a summer box office season where we have multiple big action box office draws its a nice breath of fresh air, it was a relaxing, warm and heartfelt film with various comedic quirks. The ray of sunlight that shines across one's face. I suppose this is what the film does best, to emit this feeling of warmth and closure seamlessly."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Mckenna Grace's incredible acting and Chris Evans' impeccable character made this movie, the most moving and probably the best movie I have watched since The Theory of Everything. The story line has a solid backstory and flows affluently throughout the entire movie. Octavia Spencer's amusing attitude added a soft yet fun side to the movie deviating from the serious and intriguing character of Lindsay Duncan. Mckenna Grace is a rising star and she has the ability to be an amazing actor in the future. Seeing Chris Evans in a different and normal role as Frank rather than the superhero Rogers, was quite refreshing and portrayed his softer and serious sides, showing us that he is an amazing actor."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "I loved this movie, and I will watch it again. This is my first review ever, and I've been on IMDb for years reading people's reviews to determine if I want to watch a movie or not. Does the movie have some flaws, YES! But a movie that can make me laugh, cry, feel anxious, and a whole lot of emotions I cannot explain is a win win for me. All the characters are awesome, every single one of them. Wished the movie had been 3 hours. Don't try to analyze this movie,go watch and just FEEL!"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Mckenna Grace steels your heart and is so believable as Mary. Mckenna delivers lines that are brilliant as her character is. Chris Evans as Marys' parental figure shows so much compassion for Mary that the warmth can be felt right off the screen. Will this movie make you laugh? Yes Will this movie make you cry? I did. So far this is by far my favorite movie of the year."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "The actors were good, and unusually, the child character (Mary) was as well. Mary was somebody you actually loved, and not because you were ordered to. Here's hoping that Hollywood doesn't destroy her like it has destroyed so many others. I do get the feeling about one thing regarding the movie (not to give way any plot - so forgive my slight vagueness), that maybe there was originally a different ending for this, and they were advised to rewrite it. Or maybe that's just my perception."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "what a great movie, Chris Evans & McKenna Grace together as father & daughter, so beautiful. Grace is such a talented actress, i hope to see so much more from her, just watch the movie, it will warm your heart. Lindsay Duncan, what can I say? splendid acting, did anyone like her character?!"}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Fatherhood seems to be, on different levels , a very dear issue to the latest cinematography: after \"Manchester by the sea\", \"Radin\" and \"Demain tout commence\", I bumped into this new picture, where a young man has to raise his young niece, coming to terms with unexpected paternity. Although thought-provoking , and sharing the same serious concern, the picture does not reach the quality of \"Manchester by the sea\", both in terms of screenplay and acting. Lonergan's movie had a more introspective attitude towards family bonds, and fatherhood as well. Here we find a more entertaining attitude and plot, but managing to involve the viewer: the story proceeds with a steady pace and a focused direction, probably without rolling too much in the deep, but still capable of arousing thoughts and feelings. Acting is also good, the little girl especially offers a very heartfelt interpretation in a tough role, and shows a very good chemistry with Chris Evans, who does a good job, but is less convincing than Casey Affleck. On the whole, it's an overall enjoyable movie, good for both mind and soul."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Once again Chris Evans demonstrates that he is a much better actor than he can show in comic book movies. I gave this picture a 9, based mostly on his performance. Several of the supporting roles are well played and the reviewers who remark that some of the scenes are beautifully photographed are quite right.The movie is one more exemplar of Tolstoy's famous remark that all unhappy families are unique."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "This movie is so amazing. I have to warn you though, I did cry. There were great scenes during this movie. Frank is patient, kind and amazing with Mary. Without giving anything away, I will say this. I expected it to end differently but.. the writers did leave it up for speculation. It was a very sweet and enduring movie.."}, {"score": "1/10", "review": "WTF? there's no abuse, no claim of abuse and a little girl has a paternal grandmother and biological father and an Uncle that has raised her since birth...and their solution was to make her go live in foster care...WTF kind of crap legal BS is that...this crap would not happen anywhere in real life and the movie was good all the way up to the totally unbelievable \"compromise;\" the lazy writers might as well have had space aliens come down in the middle of the movie and whisk the little girl away like Star Lord--would have been more believable !!!!!!!! This movie was trash after the foster care BS."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "This movie was absolutely amazing. The trailer caused me to expect a lot but let me tell you it did not disappoint. I believe that a lot of people would like this movie it isn't just a \"chick flick\". It may be kinda girly but I absolutely adore this movie. I would highly recommend this movie."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "A good film - about a real family. The main character has become the guardian for a young girl who is a prodigy in math - like her mother was. The film slowly reveals the reasons for the mother's suicide and that she wanted he daughter with her uncle. McKenna Grace is well chosen to play the child - even more entertaining with her front teeth missing. She shows good emotion and real reactions to the problems surrounding her care. Chris Evans was a good choice for the uncle who wants to fight for the right to do as his sister desired. He plays the part with just the right amount of frustration and love. Then there is the grandmother - at first you think you understand her and by the end she is really one of the most horrible grandmother's in film. The more you learn about her - the more you understand her daughter's problems. Control. A good film - and I am glad I saw it."}]
