[{"score": "7/10", "review": "\"Logan Lucky\" is directed by Steven Soderbergh, written by a woman whose name may in fact be a pseudonym for Steven Soderbergh. Not only is he back from retirement, he's adding to the growing number of female filmmakers. The movie is all about the Logan brothers. Jimmy was supposed to be a big football star but then a leg injury ruined all that. Clyde lost his arm in the war in Iraq. There's a rumor that the whole family might be cursed, one the brothers want to dispel. Jimmy just lost a mining job because of his disability and apparently the brothers used to pull small heist jobs years ago, but now Jimmy has a huge plan for a big score- robbing the Charlotte Motor Speedway. To do it they need the help of Joe Bang, a safe cracker who they happen to need to break out of prison. He's played by Daniel Craig, doing his best Southern accent. Listening to Craig do it is hilarious in and of itself, but Bang is also just a goof in general. Accents in general are most of the best laughs here. This movie is like the Southern answer to \"Fargo\" in that way. Channing Tatum and Adam Driver do a nice job with this stuff too. The other is that this movie is like \"Oceans Hillbillies\". Tatum and Driver aren't the sharpest tools in the shed but they're easy enough to root for. Two brothers here who seem to have been dropped on their heads repeatedly as babies. They steal the show whenever they're on screen. Leading up to the robbery that's what this is- it's just a nice, dumb comedy that's as slickly told as any of Soderbergh's past work. Does it get a bit slow? Yes, but every time there is a meeting of the minds between this dummards, it's pretty funny. Once the robbery jumps into high gear though Soderbergh doesn't pull any stops. From a stubborn prison Warden played by Dwight Yoakum, a very clever explosive device, and one of the best pop culture jokes since \"The Lego Batman Movie\" during a prison riot, Soderbergh knows comedy. He also knows how to fight to make movies his way. Using a 2 point plan, he actually managed to fund this thing mostly by himself because of the currently weak studio system that hardly ever produces anything for adults. Knowing that it's easy to avoid some of the more half-formed characters here, like Sebastian Stan's speedway driver or Seth MacFarlane as his manager. Also this thing seems like it's about to end and then Hillary Swank shows up for 20 mostly useless minutes. It has to many endings. But otherwise this is solid comedy where everyone brings their A-game and makes for a fun, if a bit too long, flick to while away the dog days of summer.

He announced his intention to retire from feature films following the release of 2013's Behind the Candelabra and cited his desire to pursue other creative interests. Well, it may have taken four years (and a brief stint directing TV's The Knick) to reignite his filmmaking passion, but Soderbergh proves his hand behind the camera is as assured as ever in the rollicking heist caper Logan Lucky.Aptly described by Soderbergh himself as an \"anti-glam version of an Ocean's movie\", Logan Lucky is a return to the style of filmmaking that made his Ocean's trilogy box office hits. The film moves at a neat pace, features a strong ensemble cast and is packed with enough twist and turns to keep things interesting throughout its two hour running time. The story follows the Logan family, brothers Jimmy (Channing Tatum) and Clyde (Adam Driver) and their sister Mellie Logan (Riley Keough), who are known for their family history of bad-luck. After loosing his job at a mine located underneath the Charlotte Motor Speedway, Jimmy plans to pull of an elaborate heist to put the Logan's financial woes behind them and break the family curse. With intricate knowledge of a series of underground tubes that run from the Speedway to a central bank vault filled with millions of dollars, Jimmy sees the perfect opening to rob the vault during a NARSCAR race. To pull it off, he enlists the help of his siblings along with bomb expert Joe Bang (a scene stealing Daniel Craig) and his two brothers, Sam (Brian Gleeson) and Fish Bang (Jack Quaid). The only problem: Joe's in prison. So on top of concocting a plan to steal the cash, they'll need to figure out a way to break Joe out of prison and get him back with no one the wiser. No pressure.It's a zany comedy about unremarkable characters punching well above their weight but through sheer luck managing to pull things off. Half the fun of the film is seeing things not happening to plan but somehow working out in the end. To its credit, the film never treats itself too seriously and invites you to laugh along with the character's mishaps and the farcical parts of the story are frequently the funniest. One gag involving a prison riot and a jab at Game of Thrones writer George R.R. Martin's glacial writing pace is as screwy as it is funny.For the most part, the film moves along at a nice pace. Just like in the Ocean's films, Soderbergh (who edits his own film) employs slick, fast cut editing to keep the heist scenes interesting and involving. He also manages to make good use of an impressive ensemble cast, with the likes of Seth MacFarlane, Katie Holmes, Katherine Waterston and Sebastian Stan all making minor but memorable appearances. And while Adam Driver and Channing Tatum both give impressive performances, the standout is an almost unrecognisable Daniel Craig playing blue-collar criminal Joe Bang. An explosions expert sporting a heavy southern accent and bright blonde hair, he's an anti-glam version of Bond if you will. It's Craig's impeccable comedic timing that will make you wish the Bond films would let him exercise his comedic chops a little bit more.It's only in the last act that the film starts to feel a little played out. The introduction of Hillary Swank as a Special Agent in the last 20 minutes of the film feels a little rushed and ultimately doesn't really go anywhere. Instead, the story continues through a number of false endings, not entirely sure when to bring down the curtain. Overall, as the first feature to draw Soderbergh out of semi-retirement, Logan Lucky is clearly something he wanted to make and his passion comes through in the final product. Produced entirely on his own and without studio interference, Logan Lucky inverts the glamour and opulence of the Ocean's trilogy without loosing the series' trademark quirks and high entertainment value. If Logan Lucky is intended to act as sort of push-back of the Hollywood system and studio meddling, then Soderbergh has succeeded at both proving a point and making you laugh while doing it."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "\"Logan Lucky\" is a fun heist adventure with lots of moving parts. The banter between our eclectic cast of characters is what really makes this film pop, as we watch them pull off feats you might think impossible. The story suffers a loss of horsepower during the back end, but a bizarre sense of morality and family loyalty help to bring things back around for a superb final lap. Take me home, country roads."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "Greetings again from the darkness. When we think of public figures retiring, we typically accept that athletes, politicians and entertainers will no longer be honing their craft or grinding in their profession. Perhaps they will write their memoirs, or even dodge TMZ completely by spending their days fishing or playing golf. When Oscar winning film director Steven Soderbergh announced he was \"retiring\" from making movies after his 2013 SIDE EFFECTS, he simply transitioned to television (excellence in \"The Knick\"). Most of us assumed it was only a matter of time until he returned to the medium that made him famous. This \"retirement\" lasted less than 4 years.When a line in the film describes it as \"Ocean's 7-11\", we can assume this is Mr. Soderbergh admitting that his \"Ocean's\" trilogy was the inspiration for this comedy-satire heist film focusing on a well-planned crime by a team of siblings, rednecks and convicts. Channing Tatum, Adam Driver and Riley Keough star as the Logan clan \u2013 Jimmy, Clyde, and Mellie, respectively. With NASCAR as the target, the Logans are joined by the Bangs: Sam (Brian Gleeson), Fish (Jack Quaid), and Joe (a scene-stealing bleached blonde Daniel Craig).Joining in the unconventional Hicksville fun are Katie Holmes and David Denman as Jimmy's ex-wife and her new husband, a recently shorn Sebastian Stan as a race car driver, Seth MacFarlane as an obnoxiously rich blow-hard, Katherine Waterston in a too-brief role as a traveling medic, Hilary Swank as a determined FBI Agent, and Dwight Yoakum as a prison warden who rarely admits a problem. Also playing a key role is the music of John Denver \u0085 a move that teeters between tribute and punchline.The set up and characters lend themselves to more laughter than we actually experience. There are more awkward moments than hilarious ones. As examples, brother Clyde's (Driver) artificial hand is the center of focus on a few occasions, as are Joe Bang's (Craig) expertise in science, and the small town West Virginia addiction to child beauty pageants. Their racetrack robbery plan is both ingenious and preposterous, which is also a fitting description of the film.A writing credit goes to \"Rebecca Blunt\", which in keeping with Soderbergh's tradition, is a pseudonym (or nom de plume) for an unnamed writer (likely Soderbergh himself). The film mostly succeeds in delivering the opposite of the traditional Ocean's slickness, and it's entertaining to watch Channing Tatum and Daniel Craig (the credits list him as \"introducing Daniel Craig) having such a good time on screen. While it doesn't deliver the laughs of FREE FIRE or TALLADEGA NIGHTS, it is nice to have Soderbergh back where he belongs. Rather than an instant classic, it's more likely to be remembered for Soderbergh's attempt to change the movie distribution channels \u0085 Google can provide the details if you are interested."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "OK, stop me when you've heard this one:James Bond with a dye job, Elvis' granddaughter, Magic Mike, Kylo Ren, and the son of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid all get together to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway during the Coca-Cola 600.Sound strange? Add Steven Soderbergh and first-time screenwriter Rebecca Blunt to that mix and you have \"Logan Lucky\". Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) is let go from his job working underground construction at the Speedway and is down on his luck. Between supporting his bartender brother, Clyde (Adam Driver), dealing with his overbearing sister, Mellie (Riley Keough), a nagging ex-wife in Bobbie Jo (Katie Holmes), and a daughter preparing for a Little Miss West Virginia pageant in Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie). Jimmy and Clyde end up working with Joe Bang (Daniel Craig), hatching a plan to break him out of prison, steal the money from the vault, and then break him back in before anyone realizes he is gone.Seeing all of these great actors playing West Virginians is worth the price of admission ALONE. (Add to that Seth McFarlane working a strange form of Australian accent as an energy drink magnate and NASCAR owner, and that mix gets even more fun.) However, this fact by itself cannot be expected to carry a two-hour runtime that \"Logan Lucky\" brings with it, and that is where my issue with it comes into play. There are many moments where I found myself laughing out loud by the complete absurdity of what was going on, but a chunk of the third act does tend to get a bit loose before everything comes together for a strong finish. The odd thing about it, though, is that I don't feel like they could have trimmed that third act up to make it any more enjoyable. It's like it teetered on completely spinning out of control but kept things just on this side of that line. This great cast does a wonderful job in filling those gaps, which is probably why I liked the cut where it stood, but I could see some of the detractors' opinions here. Given the simplicity of its characters (on purpose), it is surprisingly a bit more complex than it has to be (especially as it all unfolds), but it is not unrealistic to match the plan up to its principals. There is also Hilary Swank as the FBI agent assigned to the case, but I felt that her character was a bit rushed due to the amount of time it took to get through the caper itself, but again, I don't know that this could have been cut differently to get there quicker.The best way to frame \"Logan Lucky\" using the tried-and-true Hollywood formula is this: It's \"Oceans Eleven\" meets \"The Apple Dumpling Gang\" meets \"Little Miss Sunshine\" with a dash of \"My Name Is Earl\". There is actually a very funny way they are referred to in the film, but I really want to save that for when you actually get the chance to see it. I truly enjoyed this film and have every intention on seeing it again, so head on out!"}, {"score": "4/10", "review": "The ultimate verdict: Logan Lucky achieves both everything and nothing you expect out of a modernized crime/comedy/western.The story here focuses on Jimmy Logan, a recently divorced construction worker laid off due to his fractured leg. He enlightens his spirits, as well as our own, from his father-daughter bond right in the first frame as he repairs his car, when he tells her a story about his favorite country song. I admit these sweet moments were severely underdone, but not nearly as much as the activity of his gorgeous ex-wife, who creates zero memorability besides wearing a see-through top over a pink bra in front of her eight-year-old daughter. Matters instead revolve more about the men in the community, particularly the somewhat meaningful bond between Jimmy and his brother, a one-armed Iraqi veteran who can mix a martini one-handed.Yet everything else about this part of the United States falls into stereotypes about the culture, right down to two rednecks competing in a toilet seat ring toss. Those two guys end up being probably the most memorable characters who create the most potential comedy; now I say potential because the \"comedy\" here just lazily paints authoritative figures as gullible doofuses, especially by the third act when it turns into an unresolved \"Crime Scene Investigation\" plot from the FBI's perspective.Despite the goal toward a crime/comedy, the gags' staging missed their mark entirely\u2014the timing of the editing never played against the audience's expectations.At least they do go a bit into intriguing detail about the robbery's execution, down to a step-by-step process posted onto the refrigerator. It shows these fun little bits which make you think, \"What on earth do they plan to do with those cockroaches coated in nail polish?\" Then later you think, \"Oh! Ha! Clever!\" The details enlighten your attention, like how the number of times a plastic bag is twisted shut matters in making the contents explode.Although the culture's creation here does seem a smidgen off. I hadn't lived there longer than three months, yet I know for certain that African Americans thrive elsewhere beyond the prisons. The fact that one of those crooks, played with a convincing accent by James Bond actor Daniel Craig, escapes jail to help others commit their robbery draws one common conclusion: the US's most vibrant criminal culture thrives in the Southeast. While true in some regards, we deserve to see some light down there too.Yes, the worldbuilding basically just got the job done well enough. The same goes to the acting\u2014the best they achieve from their effort is simply sustaining your attention. Yet the smaller performances are really the more effective ones, as Hilary Swank (Boys Don't Cry, Million Dollar Baby) made the most out of her small part, playing an investigator with her expected authoritative enthusiasm. The director, Steven Soderbergh, (Erin Brockovich, Traffic) proved his strength at casting seventeen years after beating himself at the Oscars, you see each well-known actor only as the character they portray. However, the way Soderbergh organizes the moments of his story is distractingly wrong.Soderbergh displays lots of detailed love for the East Coast's racing culture, such as a fiery feud between a rude racer who insults the two disabled leads. It feels truer to the culture than what the financially successful Cars franchise attempted. But I think Soderbergh misunderstands something important: very few people, particularly outside the East Coast, care as much about NASCAR as he does, a distraction at best in the way he flaunts the commercialism.The bits at the car race, in particular, abuse too many lingering shots on the fans and bumper stickers, like one big NASCAR commercial. They even blare the name of \"Fox News\" when showing the game's commentators.You could honestly tell this was screenwriter Rebecca Blunt's first ever writing credit, no craft goes into sending out any kind of motivation to anyone besides the two brothers to achieve anything, which hurts the film all the more, particularly with its unresolved established family commitment. Nobody learns anything, they all just exist as catalysts towards material gain.Even if you lived in the southeast, you will most possibly forget the name Logan Lucky the next day. You'd be better off watching a car race live or watching CSI Miami, both a far more rewarding social experience."}, {"score": "2/10", "review": "TheTruthDoor will not lie to you....this is an awful film.What kind of movie is \"Logan Lucky\" exactly?

Arguably it's the first of its kind this decade, since the last time a really good movie of this stripe has focused on downhill good 'ol boys pulling an all-American snatch-and-grab, Burt Reynolds was still relevant. In its advertising the film mentions itself in the same breath as Ocean's Eleven (2001) but aside from both having the same director, the two couldn't be more miles apart. One's about career confidence men drinking fancy martinis. The other's about petty criminals snatching chump change from concession drawers. One's essentially Michael Caine, the other is Steve Martin.As such, Logan Lucky doesn't come with the standard beats and rhythms of your average Italian Job (2003). It's slower, quirkier, meanders down narrative avenues then calls it all back in drastically different ways. While doing so it's also more human, more sympathetic calling to mind the best aspects of The Big Deal on Madonna Street (1958) with a uniquely Appalachian twang.Recently let go from his construction job due to, \"liability reasons with insurance,\" former football prodigy Jimmy Logan (Tatum) decides to put in motion a robbery plan he's obviously been thinking about for some time. He recruits his siblings, hairdresser Mellie (Keough) and one-handed bartender Clyde (Driver), to aid him. Then they knock on the door of infamous local demolitions expert and safe cracker Joe Bang (Craig) whose incarceration proves the first snag of many to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway.As with all heist movies, much of the entertainment stems from the tension created when the plan, as described to the satisfaction of the audience deviates ever so slightly risking exposure. What Logan Lucky doesn't just get right but gets near darn perfect is the way it plays with that convention. Large problems seem to wash over the ensemble with increasing grace almost as if they know they can rely on their community; family and own God-given intelligence to carry the day. Minor problems come across as inspired character moments for which Jimmy, Joe Bang and his brothers (Quaid and Gleeson) show their goofy, simple, superstitious selves.I say goofy and simple not to be derivative, though if that's what you take from it then the film's prestige may come as a more pleasant surprise than you could hope for. Much of the plan relies on other characters, such as a stuffy prison warden (Yoakam) and a haughty race promoter (MacFarlane) to underestimate our ensemble's abilities.The film does an excellent job humanizing our heroes by exploring and framing their environments as a point of fact. Jimmy doesn't live in squalor; he lives in a cozy house overlooking the West Virginia hills. Clyde isn't a one-handed freak, he's a war hero and a dedicated bartender to boot, Mellie, a capable getaway driver, the Bang brothers - professional bandits who \"know all the twitters\". The camera further highlights this by panning and gliding at low angles making everyone loom larger; everyone including a late third act addition in Hilary Swank as a resourceful FBI investigator.The film is not without its faults. The pacing seems to shift up and down like a Mustang barreling down the Eastbound I-64. And despite its knack for air-tight alibis, Logan Lucky leaves the audience hanging with a lot of unanswered questions. Given the controversy surrounding the financing of the film, there's little doubt a sequel is being planned. One which I look forward to, but if film is said to be poetic justice in a hundred minutes or less, Logan Lucky doesn't come across as poetic as it should be.All that said, Steven Soderbergh's Logan Lucky is a breeze. It's a fine and feral addition to the pantheon of good time slice-of-life crime comedies that were first kicked off by Dirty Mary Crazy Larry (1974) and the like. And its quirkiness is helped immensely by its motley cast who by enlarge do wonders humanizing characters that otherwise would have been shrouded in misplaced mythos. If you've been curious about this one, do yourself a favor and check it out."}, {"score": "5/10", "review": "'See how the other half steals' is a cheeky, but apt, tagline for this redneck heist comedy. Whereas Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's trilogy was all charm, glitz and high-class robbery, here the director puts a down-on-their-luck West Virginian family front and centre. Channing Tatum's Jimmy Logan is the George Clooney of the movie, except he's unshaven, has a potbelly and hobbles around due to a knee injury that stopped him going pro. But he has a heart of gold. His brother Clyde (Adam Driver) is the Brad Pitt of the piece, although he's socially awkward, has shaggy hair and can't let go of what he sees as a multi-generational family curse. And he only has one arm. Sister Mellie Logan (Riley Keough), local safecracker Joe Bangs (Daniel Craig, bleached blonde hair and a bit on the crazy side) and his hillbilly cousins Fish and Sam (Jack Quaid and Brian Gleeson) round out the crew. Their goal: to steal millions from a major annual Nascar event. How? By infiltrating the underground tube system utilised throughout the day to transport cash from all of the food and merchandise outlets to a secure vault. Tilting the comedy scales more towards low-key humour, Soderbergh tries to find a tone that is both tongue-in-cheek and flippant whilst also wanting to be taken seriously in parts. It's a risky move, and one that doesn't always pay off. Finding a way to relate to, or empathise with these characters isn't easy, hence there's no great desire to see them pull off their elaborate scheme. What's left is a mild intrigue to see the trickery on show, but it's a bit hollow without the investment in the key players. Props to Soderbergh for injecting a show-stopping beauty pageant sing-a-long in the final act; 11-year-old Farrah McKenzie (playing Tatum's daughter) singing John Denver's 'Take Me Home, Country Roads' is one of the most touching\u2014and unashamedly American\u2014scenes of the year. Some fine moments and an intriguing concept meshed in with a weird tone and uninteresting characters result in Logan Lucky being merely middle-of-the-road.

It's almost worth eight bucks just to see if Daniel Craig can act all \"muricann.\" And yes, Channing Tatum is actually pretty convincing as a hard-workin' country boy down on his luck. And there's plenty of John Denver references! But in the end, the movie goes nowhere, and in this summer of wretched movies, we're left with another stinker. Almost nothing is funny, and nothing is interesting. The movie goes way too long as they spend the last half-hour \"unraveling the mystery\" while Hilary Swank glowers incessantly. And their attempts to capture some of that Boyd Crowder-esque, crazy hillbilly lifestyle just fall flat every time.What's even more remarkable, is once again, the IMDb user review/metacritic machine has awarded a ridiculously high rating to a very mediocre movie.

Probably because they represent the anti-establishment and the boundaries that life sets. Though we have our fair share of stories about heroic cops that capture the villains, when we look at it from another perspective, the villain can often come out as the true hero. One often premise is that life has been unfair to someone and they want to balance out everything by taking what's theirs. Whether their right to do it is usually left to the viewers, but its common that part of the story has an officer looking for them.Today's movie is heist movie by Steven Soderbergh, who you may remember having directed the Ocean's 11 remake and their sequels. This also marks a theatrical return for the director since his Liberace movie, Behind the Candelabra. So we already know that not only can he deliver a good heist movie, but is likely to shoot it in more of an auteur fashion. The big difference here is that while the Ocean movies were about classy criminals stealing from a casino, the heroes here are robbing a Speedway during a NASCAR race. This is Logan Lucky. Jimmy Logan (played by Channing Tatum) was a once a potential football star whose career was cut short due to a leg injury. Now left with a permanent limp and lack of experience that makes finding work difficult, he's having a hard time paying for child support let alone support himself. He does have his brother Clyde (played by Adam Driver) for help. Though Clyde himself is an Iraq war veteran with a missing arm. After a fight with NASCAR driver Max Chilblain (played by Seth MacFarlane), Jimmy calls out \"cauliflower\", which is code for when he and his brother should commit a crime.As Jimmy's previous job as a construction worker game him working knowledge of the Charlotte Motor Speedway's cash flowing system, they both agree to rob the place. They end up hiring a safecracker whose serving time in jail Joe Bang (played by Daniel Craig). They develop a plan for Clyde to get himself incarcerated and for him and Joe to escape temporarily during the upcoming Coca Cola 600 race. Once a prison riot commences, the two make it out and everyone meets up underground to commence the robbery. For a simple story about not very bright robbers, this was a fun movie. Was it great? I wouldn't go that far, but it's entertaining and gave me my money's worth at the movies. It's clear that this film isn't trying to make a bold statement, but rather provide a simple caper (a lot like this years earlier Going in Style). I'll say upfront that I honestly haven't heard of a NASCAR heist story before. Not only how they do the heist is interesting, but you actually do become curious to see just how they orchestrate this. As I said, these are not smart crooks, but they do their best given their situation and the resources available. Most of the performances are good, like the ones from Channing Tatum and Adam Driver; their passable, but nothing new. My biggest surprise came from Daniel Craig, playing a rare American character. Maybe its because I'm so used to seeing him as James Bond, that almost anything besides that will catch my interest. Thankfully, it pays off, as he plays him in a more comedic fashion then I would have expected. Is there a comedic bug within Daniel Craig we don't know about?While the preparation and actual heist proved to be fun, it's the conclusion where things slow down and not in a good way. The last twenty minutes feels like that they go on for way too long. I tries to expand the story by adding an FBI investigation subplot that not only comes out of nowhere, but I added very little. Despite a committed Hillary Swank playing the role of a detective, they could have cut this out and it would have not changed the story much. It certainly doesn't ruin the rest of the movie, but it's like the editing added more padding for a longer runtime.I'll give this seven prosthetic arms out of ten. Lucky Logan is the kind of caper story that has a lot of creativity, but could have used more of it when it came to the ending. This is not much of an action movie, but rather a comedy. I think it's worth the watch at least once. On a rainy day, it would have to be a TV movie."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "If anyone were to ask me what was the best filmmaker barely anyone had heard of, I would tell them it would be Steven Soderbergh. Sure, we can recall works from Christopher Nolan, Edgar Wright, The Wachowskis, Spielberg, etc. but they never consider the sly brilliance of Soderbergh's work. The man who made OCEAN'S ELEVEN, TRAFFIC, MAGIC MIKE, SIDE EFFECTS, OUT OF SIGHT, and THE INFORMANT, Soderbergh is a natural talent of crafting airtight entertainment who admittedly never really sought to be \"mainstream\" so much as he just like to do his own thing. But every time he pops his head out the tunnel he calls his \"semi-retirement\" he shows us just how easy pure crowd pleasers can be made, and LOGAN LUCKY is no different.Airtight, breezy, and full-stop hilarious, LOGAN LUCKY is a blast from start to finish. In a Hollywood climate that fails so hard in making good heist thrillers, this film succeeds in many ways that almost seem like showboating.Explaining the plot seems arbitrary, since it's basically OCEANS ELEVEN for Rednecks. A team of down-on-their-luck men plan an elaborate robbery from a place of riches. Instead of swinging upper class men, we get working class dudes from the rural south. Instead of the MGM Grand, it's the NASCAR derby. It seems like just yet another re-skinning of the original movie, but along the way feels like its own thing.Paying lovely attention to detail to it's Southern setting, the whole setting feels grounded and honest. Many other films that depict this sort of climate do so to make fun of it, but Soderbergh never goes that route. Even if the film objectively is a comedy, there's a real sincerity to the this place, immersing us to an era where country music means something dear to us and derby races were the hottest trend. There's a scene where one of the characters daughters sing his favorite country song in a pageant, and it's probably the most heartwarming tribute to the rural life that I've ever seen in a movie.And once we get to the actual heist, it looks about as cool as you expect. Just like the OCEAN films, the heist itself is little more than crazy elaborate scenarios that lead up to the big catch. Mark my words, guys; it gets stupidly elaborate, as if its orchestrated to tackle every minute loophole or detail to fend off those who try to question each plot hole of the heist. At one point they gain access to a bank with cockroaches in which it leads to a domino effect of conveniences. It's near implausible, but I never wanted it to stop.But if the heist was a really delicious cake, the performances would be the frosting. Adam Driver is great as a war vet with a secret temper that shook me by surprise. Channing Tatum's choice of going for comedic roles should be a staple for hot white actors for now on, but he imbues sincerity among his buffoonery. Katie Holmes looks near unrecognizable.Heck, even Seth McFarlane got a laugh out of me! But the biggest star here is Daniel Craig, who is a straight up revelation here. Constantly slogging looking plain dreadful in the BOND movies, he finally looks like he's having fun as an Australian bomb expert called Joe Bang and it pays off. He chews the scenery in every scene he's in, mixing a weird mixture of intimidation and cheesy ham.LOGAN LUCKY may not be totally perfect - Hillary Swank is trying too hard as a CIA agent, and the subplot with Katherine Waterson feels obligatory - but it is a rocking good time. With airtight editing, a breezy yet enjoyable heist, and an overall love to its setting, Soderbergh once again proves to be an unsung master yet again. Do not miss this!"}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Steven Soderbergh is responsible for many good things. Traffic, Oceans Eleven. Even his later efforts such as Side Effects and his foray into television with The Girlfriend Experience (and the film itself) are quite solid. I actually didn't keep up and realize he retired from film, only to return with Logan Lucky. I definitely was excited for this film though as it looked to be a comedic heist film along the lines of Ocean's Eleven, just with a southern twist. I have to say, Logan Lucky has exceeded my expectations and is a ton of fun from start to finish.The film is about Jimmy Logan who recently gets fired at his job and his plans to pull off a heist during the Coca-Cola 600 race. He recruits his one handed brother, his sister, bomb making expert from prison, and his two rather dim-witted brothers. As with Oceans Eleven the heist is slick and smart. There are comedic moments throughout which just makes the heist so much for fun. As with many of Soderbergh's previous efforts there are memorable characters littered throughout the film and nearly all of them are likable.I think the best of the bunch is Daniel Craig in the most bizarre role you will ever see him in. He's a cooky, quotable, yet very smart criminal who knows exactly what he is doing. Apparently the screenwriter for this film is a Rebecca Blunt, who no one in the cast has actually met. This leads me to think that Soderbergh is using a pseudonym and not for the first time in his career. No shame in hiding from a very well written film. There's probably holes and things that could have been written better near the end but it doesn't take away from the overall quality of the film.The film is quite self-aware. They have a knock on the film calling it the \"Oceans 7/11\". Everything link together and gels quite nicely as you would expect with a remarkable heist film. Soderbergh's cinematography is usually very good and as usual that's no different here. This \"Peter Andrews\" is very good at that, huh? I think above all the chemistry and comedic timing with the characters is what makes this film a very positive viewing experience. There's never a dull moment, and if there is a dull moment its through one of the characters literally having a dull moment where they forget something during the heist. Overall, its up there in Soderbergh's filmography and is likely the last good film of the summer.8/10"}, {"score": "5/10", "review": "The script wasn't bad, and the actors were all great.

Because of the glacial pace, the humor never really gets going-- it's like trying to roll a snowball down a hill, but it only goes a few feet before stopping, then they have to set up the next joke all over again.If they cut this down to 90 minutes, it would have been a lot more exciting and funny to watch, but at just under 2 hours, it felt like a drag."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Jimmy Logan orchestrates a plan to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina.

If Donald Westlake was still writing his wacky but sincere and dark-in-the-margins comic capers, he might write something like this. It's not some grand masterpiece for an auteur to return with, but then Soderbergh wouldn't do that in a million cinematic years. He just makes his movies and he always has done that, and people either come or they don't (I remember an interview with him where he said he considers himself quite lucky due to having so many failures post 'Sex Lies' before finally getting back on his feet in the late 90's and that he'd probably be done if he did that today, but I digress).The point is, it's another of his crime films, and it's among the more entertaining ones, full of charm and wit and a grouping of actors (*Introducing* Daniel Craig) who get to play pretend while at the same time inhabiting what is a very real part of the country for a lot of people: the NASCAR, John Denver/Bob Seger loving South Heartland where, you know, times are tough all over. Even Katharine Waterston, who at first I thought was superfluous to the story, adds to it as a nurse who provides free health care to West Virginians who \"don't like the word charity.\" This is the kind of movie where every actor, whether it's Riley Keough or Seth MacFarlane (who my wife didn't even recognize until I told her after it ended), are having a great time and it shows. It's a movie that has some pep in it step, this almost (by design probably, Soderbergh's a weird motherf***er like that) in contradiction to at times a lot of long takes and shots that let the actors inhabit the frame and take over, whether they move around or not. And as its plot moves along we know that this won't be an 'Oceans', at least in the way that characters mess up or kinks in the character's heist go on, and a major part of the fun is to spot when it might happen or to try and keep up with what may be a red herring or a genuine slip-up or something that is both a tiny or major plant to pay off later on. Meanwhile the soundtrack rocks, and its not in a way that puts *too* much attention on itself, just enough that it gives set pieces and little moments a distinct energy (i.e. \"Roadrunner\" as we see a montage of the Speedway as Tatum describes the layout to brother Driver).And certainly has its issues - Hillary Swank is so the weak link it's astonishing - but is a filmmaker, like Edgar Wright earlier this summer with Baby Driver, having the time of his life playing in the genre sandbox while creating amazing comic characters that you can take seriously. It also certainly has moments that the filmmaker clearly means to make us cringe while recognizing the cringe factor... or at least one, when Jimmy's little girl is giving her talent show performance (looking like, though she's a little older, one of those Toddlers & Tiaras kids, totally freakish in the make-up with the hair and giant eyes), as everyone is moved by it and sings along to 'Country Road', and... is it meant to be a heartfelt moment or Soderbergh satirizing how the South, where he came from (Louisiana, close enough to where this is), has a big heart despite the moments that make one take a step back.But Soderbergh doesn't make this moment one that is easy to say 'This is SATIRE!' It doesn't work like that for him either: this movie is all of a piece, as a shaggy crime story, the likes of which where the laziest (funniest) prison riot in movie history occurs involving a demand to the warden (there's another one, Dwight Yoakam!) that I won't mention here as it'd spoil a wonderful scene, while at the same time also a movie that is not subtle about its American commentary - both brothers are crippled in one way or another, one from Iraq, another from football, but so it goes - and also not shying away from having dumb but stubborn types. Daniel Craig might seem like one, but he's just having a blast a) being a real character actor again, getting to not be submerged in star power for a role like this (MacFarlane gets to do that too, and both swap accents), and b) the actors playing his brothers are \"those types\" we usually associate with rednecks... and they are, but there's a little more quirkiness there as well.I hope to check this out several more times over the years, maybe as soon as it hits video, and yet I also hope more people try to get to see it in theaters before it disappears; it didn't have a strong opening weekend, so in a sense it's Soderbergh going right back to where he was in the 90's, just doing what he does and experimenting in the form of cinema while also delivering the goods as an entertainer.

I don't think I've ever liked Katie Holmes in a movie, and she was pretty atrocious in this. I'd say the entertainment value is also 50/50.

This one has two guys who have a long history with each other (one of them dealing with a hostile ex-wife) who decide to rob a large entertainment venue during on especially busy day. They put together a motley crew to pull off their plan, which is very intricate, involving many moving pieces and requiring a few lucky breaks along the way. We don't see the extent to which everything came together until flashback scenes toward the end of the movie and, in the last scene, we're left with the impression that the story may not be as complete as we thought.Oh, but I wasn't just talking about the subject of this review, the comedy crime drama \"Logan Lucky\" (PG-13, 1:59). Everything I said in the previous paragraph also applies to the 2001 crime drama \"Ocean's 11\". It only makes sense. This movie's director, Steven Soderbergh, also directed the first three \"Ocean's\" movies (including the 2004 and 2007 sequels, but not counting the 2018 all-female \"Ocean's 8\" for which he's as producer). (However, he did not write any of these films \u2013 or his Oscar-winning effort, \"Traffic\", or \"Erin Brockovich\", \"Contagion\", \"Side Effects\" or \"Magic Mike\", all of which he also directed.) Soderbergh's 2017 heist movie has a lot in common with some of his previous work, but has a very different setting \u2013 the southern U.S. This is \"Ocean's 11\" meets \"Talladega Nights\". The Logans make up one of the most UN-lucky families in the South. At least, that's what Clyde Logan (Adam Driver) believes. He can rattle off a long list of relative misfortune to anyone who will listen, especially to his older brother, Jimmy (Channing Tatum). Jimmy had been a star high school quarterback and appeared destined to play college ball and then move on to the pros\u0085 until a leg injury ended those dreams and left Jimmy with a permanent limp. Since then, he married a woman named Bobbie Jo (Katie Holmes), had a daughter named Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie) and got divorced. Since Bobbie Jo got full custody, Jimmy has to drive from Charlotte, North Carolina to West Virginia to visit his daughter (which he does frequently\u0085 but not always reliably) and support her participation in beauty pageants.Complicating matters further, Jimmy just loses his job working construction in the tunnels underneath the Charlotte Motor Speedway (due to liability issues related to his bum leg). For his part, Clyde is a disabled military veteran who lost his left hand and forearm in Iraq. Clyde is now a sad sack bartender who never smiles, usually speaks in a monotone and is\u0085 kinda slow. One day, British businessman and NASCAR team owner Max Chilblain (Seth MacFarlane) comes into Clyde's bar and begins mocking his disability. Jimmy defends his brother, gets into a fight and destroys Chillblain's car, and the incident gets on Jimmy's last nerve. He decides to stand up for the little guy \u2013 and take a bold step to change his life.Jimmy cooks up a scheme to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway. Having worked that underground construction job, he knows how they move the money, where they store it and how to get to it. Clyde convinces Jimmy to join him, but they're gonna need more help. They visit an old acquaintance named Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) who is an explosives expert. One problem \u2013 Joe is \"in-car-cer-ated\" (as he sarcastically reminds the brothers) \u2013 and is up for parole soon. They say they can get him out of jail to do the job and get him back before he's missed. Joe decides to trust Jimmy and Clyde \u2013 but not completely.Joe insists that his brothers be a part of the heist. Jimmy and Clyde recruit Sam Bang (Brian Gleeson) and Fish Bang (Jack Quaid), even though the Bangs says they \"walk with God now\" and need \"a moral reason\" to do the job. The Logans invent one, add their younger sister, Mellie (Riley Keough), to the crew and Jimmy's plan takes shape. Along the way, Clyde gets himself thrown in jail (on purpose), the robbery has to be moved up a week (to Memorial Day Weekend!), and other problems arise, but Jimmy gets everything set and he makes a phone call, saying \"call the baker\", a signal which sets the plan in motion. After the job, Logan's Six must try to avoid suspicion from FBI agents (led by Hillary Swank).\"Logan Lucky\" is a pleasant enough diversion, but not especially creative. Soderbergh himself calls it \"an anti-glam version of an Ocean's movie\", but he doesn't make especially good use of his setting. Although the locations, circumstances and people are indeed \"all South all the time\", the script isn't as funny as it tries to be and most of the cleverness comes from heist movie clich\u00e9s. Country music fans will enjoy the soundtrack (with special attention paid to John Denver's \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\"), but may wonder whether they're laughing at these unsophisticated characters \u2013 or with them.

The film follows the genre's formula pretty closely, but Steven Soderbergh injects the film with some comic gusto that is mostly on target and casts his film with actors willing to play the fool.Now Steven Soderbergh is no stranger to this crime drama genre, having directed the Ocean 11 films. Back from a short retirement, he has made a movie that celebrates all of the hallmark elements of crime and absurdity. No, it doesn't come anyway near his master works like Traffic, Michael Clayton, or the underrated Contagion. But it doesn't try to reach that zenith. This is a highly entertaining caper movie with enough droll wit and irony in large helpings. One can hark back to an earlier time when the good ole boy comedies of the 80's variety frequented the movie houses, that country fried action flick that made Burt Reynolds a bundle of money.\ufffcGetting that big bundle of money is also the main goal in Logan Lucky, by any available means, mostly illegally, in this scenario. Life has not gone particularly smooth for Logan Brothers. Not very smart and with a run of bad luck in their miserable lives, these white trash siblings are thought to be cursed. Jimmy (a wonderfully appealing Channing Tatum) is divorced and recently laid-off. Clyde (an amusing Adam Driver), a war veteran with a prosthetic hand, runs a seedy bar. After a chance encounter, Jimmy hatches an elaborate scheme to rob a raceway of its NASCAR loot. They assemble a motley crew of misfits to set their plan into action.\ufffcEverything is slightly askew in this story, from the dopey antics of its colorful characters and their over-the-top Southern accents to the dense plotting that depends solely on happenstance. The narrative defies logic. Mr. Tatum's character is pure country rube, yet he becomes a criminal mastermind who can easily work out any kinks in this elaborate scheme of riches. That said, the storytelling keeps one's involvement throughout the film, making Lucky Logan complete fun.Credit the good screenplay by Rebecca Blunt and an adroit cast. The heist itself, with its clever twists, is always compelling. The aforementioned Mr. Tatum and Mr. Driver make a great tag team. Solid supporting turns are given by an ensemble that includes Katie Holmes, Riley Keough, and Dwight Yoakam. Also making memorable cameo appearances are Hilary Swank, Seth MacFarlane, and Katherine Waterston. Jack Quaid and Brian Gleeson provide the wonderful corn-pone humor. However, the most enjoyable award goes to Daniel Craig as Joe Bang, a safe-cracker and an unsafe cracker with a penchant for risky behavior. He turns in a delightful comic performance just this side of caricature.\ufffcThe talented Mr, Soderburgh directed, photographed, and edited this caper film with such effortless skill. He captures that red state mentality and unabashed patriotism with his subtle images while focusing on the complex crime caper and its quirky characters. In Logan Lucky, all of the characters' flaws and foibles are charming Southern comfort. So grab a beer! Let's hear it for the boys!

The script was written by first time feature screenwriter Rebecca Blunt (although some suspect that's an alias for someone else), and the film stars Channing Tatum (who's acted in Soderbergh's last four theatrical films now), Adam Driver, Daniel Craig, Riley Keough, Seth MacFarlane, Jack Quaid, Brian Gleeson, Katie Holms, Katherine Waterston, Hillary Swank and Dwight Yoakam. It tells the story of three siblings plotting to rob the Coca-Cola 600 race (in Concord, North Carolina), during Memorial Day weekend. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, but it's also underperformed at the Box Office so far. The movie feels a lot like a redneck version of an 'OCEANS' movie (which Soderbergh has said was his main reason for coming out of retirement to do it), so it's about as entertaining as you can imagine that being.Jimmy (Tatum), Clyde (Driver) and Mellie Logan (Keough) are three hard working siblings in Concord, North Carolina. Jimmy believes that the three's current bad luck is due to a family curse. Hoping to reverse the curse, Jimmy plots a very complicated robbery; which ends up taking place at the Coca-Cola 600 race (on Memorial Day weekend). The entire preparation, and execution, of the robbery plays out just like a redneck version of an 'OCEANS' movie (like I already said).The film is funny, and it's definitely cleverly written and competently directed. The performances are all good as well, especially Daniel Craig (and it's nice to see him giving a great performance outside of a Bond flick). The heist is a little too overcomplicated though (like the 'OCEANS' trilogy), but it is fun to watch (even if it's hard to keep up with at times). I like Steven Soderbergh films, but I think he's just a little too much 'style over substance'. The characters are all well developed in this though (like all of his movies), but maybe just a little too cartoonish and clich\u00e9d at times (like a lot of his films are as well). It's pretty much everything you'd expect from a Soderbergh movie, and nothing more.

With dashes of Shane Black and the Coens, it's a redneck Ocean's Eleven (\"Ocean's 7/11\", according to the movie) which replaces tailored suits with ratty southern rock t-shirts. It's another twisty, cool, hilarious heist movie that cements Soderbergh as king of the comedic-crime-caper. Tatum and Driver play a pair of down-and-out brothers who've discovered a fool-proof opportunity to rob a racetrack. Throughout the humor and the crime, Soderbergh gives a great representation of income disparity and the modern American class system that actually warrants its soundtrack's use of \"Fortunate Son\". It would make Bernie Sanders proud; however, despite it's having a clear point-of-view, it's never forceful. The movie is as interested (if not more so) in the soul of its characters as their politics. This gives room for the story to envelope, the humor to shine, and unexpectedly moving moments seep in. Tatum's relationship with his daughter and even a group singalong of \"Country Roads\" bypass the corniness under Soderbergh's heartfelt care. It's a shame this isn't making much money at the box office, but it's not surprising either; it has \"cult-sleeper-hit\" written all over it. The performers are entertainingly cast against type (Craig's roughneck southern boy is wonderful), there's a cavalcade of non-sequiturs and one-liners around each turn, and it takes about 15 minutes to find its unique tonal rhythm.

He's divorced from his ex-wife Bobbie Jo (Katie Holmes), he keeps missing out on major events in his daughter's (Farrah Mackenzie) life, and he's just been fired from his job due to a bad limp that makes him an insurance liability. Until one night, when he hatches a plan to turn his financial woes around- he crafts a brilliant scheme to pull off a major heist at the same North Carolina NASCAR track where he was just fired from his construction job. But there's a catch: he needs to assemble a crew of like-minded goofballs to pull it off, including his troubled one-handed war-veteran brother Clyde (Adam Driver) and an incarcerated demolitions expert who calls himself \"Joe Bang.\" (Daniel Craig in a scene-stealing performance)This is a film built entirely on the interactions and development of characters placed into extraordinary circumstances, and \"Logan Lucky\" completely excels on all fronts. Every single performer involved is giving it their all, and everyone does a fantastic job with the phenomenally amusing characters created by screenwriter Rebecca Blunt. Tatum and Driver are both incredible and play off each-other exceptionally as two brothers who love one-another despite their differences and sometimes conflicting personalities. The film wisely gives them both a lot of sympathy and flaws so that the audience never turns against them, and despite what they're doing being completely illegal, you'll quickly find yourself rooting for them. Supporting roles by the likes of Mackenzie, Holmes, Riley Keough and even a small turn by Hillary Swank are all played very well and lend a lot to the proceedings. And of course there's Daniel Craig... Fans who only know him as the latest James Bond might very well want to check this movie out, because Craig shows just how versatile and talented an actor he really is- he is the highlight here, and gives one of the most amusing and entertaining performances of the year.The storyline Blunt crafts serves as a great groundwork for director Soderbergh to develop on, and the movie is very well constructed and paced. Soderbergh's eye for keen visuals and slick composition is on full display, and the film is quite the aesthetic treat, making good use of its Southern setting and the NASCAR related imagery, which helps build both mood and tension. In many ways, you could say that \"Logan Lucky\" is the \"redneck\" variation of his earlier \"Ocean's Eleven\" trilogy- and I don't mean that in a bad way at all. It's quirky and character driven with fantastic direction and beautifully crafted imagery. Soderbergh also wisely lets scenes play out at an organic pacing, so the razor-sharp writing is on full-display, and the constant and very effective subtle humor is allowed to sink in. It's infectiously charming and even if you don't laugh out loud at every scene, you'll definitely find yourself grinning ear to ear and giggling madly throughout.There really isn't a single thing I can say to the film's detriment. It's a perfect, well-oiled machine that knows exactly what it is, and places all of its focus on being the best it can be. And it's incredibly refreshing at the end of a summer season that was filled with a lot of enjoyable but flawed works and a fair share of duds. Great characters. Fantastic performances. Wonderful and witty writing. And classy visual direction. Four key ingredients that come together and make \"Logan Lucky\" one of my favorite films of the year. I have no choice but to give it a perfect 10 out of 10. If you're on the fence, please give it a shot. Little films like this are invaluable and deserve a lot more exposure than they get."}]
