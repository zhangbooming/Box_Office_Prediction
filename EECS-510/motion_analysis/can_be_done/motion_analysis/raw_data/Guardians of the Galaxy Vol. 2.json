It was funny, witty, well scripted - it was all pieced together very well. While the sequel did have its good moments, it seemed to want to ride on the first film's coattails; rather than make an effort to be a great movie on it's own. Grut's character especially seemed overdone and a bit forced on this one. This franchise really deserves a better sequel. They were off to a great start and it's disappointing and even slightly annoying that they would follow that with such a lukewarm attempt at a sequel."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 is freaking good from the very beginning till end! If you like the first chapter, then you'll definitely love Volume 2. The relations between every character evolve and every one of them got a special moment in the movie. Now, we all knew that Baby Groot is adorable and predictably he'll stole the show, but man...Drax, Rocket, Gamora, Nebula, Yondu even Mantis they're all awesome in their way. Of Course Star Lord makes what he can do best, leading the group of a**holes.The cinematography, the stable and funny story, the brilliant colors, that James Gunn added to this movie are just fabulous! The comedy is totally on point. Action scenes are great. The music? Well you can listen the GOTG Vol.2 songs over and over again and they all works perfectly in the context of the movie.Phase 3 of MCU is very strong first with Civil War, then Doctor Strange and now Guardians doesn't disappoint at all. This is truly one hell of a movie and you MUST watch it at any cost!

And before I tell you about the movie, I feel compelled to tell you that I went to watch this movie with 15 excited fans of the first movie - 5 of which were comic book readers and the rest (you do the math) had watched the first one and couldn't wait to watch the sequel, but are not comic book readers. Now, remember this, because I'm going to give you some of their reactions at the end of the review. OK, now let us begin with the actual review. If I'm to put it in one sentence, I'll say that it was fun, but not that much and that it was a one time watch. Star Lord and the gang start off with the usual shenanigans that have you laughing, sipping your coke, eating your popcorn happily and adoring little Groot. The beginning of the movie is pretty much what the trailer shows us. James Gunn made us fall in love with the GoTG in the first film and in this film, he gives us more reasons to care about them as we delve into each of their pasts. The not-so-subtle theme of family is cute, but at times forced and feels like...and I quote one of my fellow movie-goer friends - \"Fast and the Furious in space\". For me this movie was driven solely by the characters and not by the story. While watching the movie, I realised that all of THIS would be better as a TV show. At one point in the movie I was like, yeah this is great, I'm laughing, but where is this going? It all seemed pointless some 45 minutes-1 hr into the movie. I had a Batman v Superman Deja Vu (only this Deja Vu was shorter and colourful). The movie suffers greatly due to the lack of a good villain and forced cheesy dialogues. Towards the end, I was like \"Man! This is Flash and Arrow level of whining.\" Fortunately, the characters keep you interested and for my Rocket is the real MVP of the whole movie. I friggin loved every line he said. Drax was awesome as ever, Groot was bloody adorable. Gamora was under-utilised, Quill was funny (that's it). Amongst the other characters, Peters dad was decent, Yondu was great and Mantis was good in the limited role she had. Im sure there will be others who will reach the point i reached in the movie when i thought it was going nowhere, but might be happy with the movie overall all as there is a big emotional payback in the end of the movie. For me, that was not enough to hide it's short-comings. Loved the END (the proper end, not the villain fight - I thought that was okayish and predictable, but funny nonetheless). All in all, a decent, funny movie, that is led down by the weak writing. It doesn't quite live up to the benchmark set by the first part. Oh and out of the 5 post credits scene, the 4th one is the important one. Ratings - 6.5/10 PS - Here are few of the reactions from my friends - Comic book reader friend 1 - \"That was so much fun\" Comic book reader friend 2 - \"I liked it, but could've been better\" Comic book reader friend 3 - \"So funny\" Non-Comic book reader friend 1 - \"Bro, you didn't tell me we were watching Fast and the Furious in space\" Non-Comic book reader friend 2 - \"Garbage\" Non-Comic book reader friend 3 - \"One time watch\""}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "With the second installment into the inter-galactic world of the marvel universe we had already come to love from the first Guardians of the Galaxy, James Gunn proves himself wisely in his second approach, meeting as much anticipation as the fans of the world had expected. James Gunn takes us on a thrilling action adventure that is as humorous as it is exciting. You should approach the film expecting to be constantly laughing through almost every, if not every single scene. And you will also be surprised not to come short on the more alternate of emotions as well, as this turns into one of Marvels most emotionally breathtaking films to date. This riveting sequel is not one to leave it's fans walking out of the cinema with their heads hanging down in disappointment. But rather left glued to their seats wanting more, even after the commencement of the five post-credit scenes.The films highs: -Provided as much retro beats dominated action sequences we all once again hoped for, after such success from the first films feel worthy approach. -Brought us countless laughs and non-stop humor throughout the films entire run. -Great character development proved significant to the story lines success. -Turned an action comedy into a nightmare thriller in a matter of a few suspenseful sequences.\n \n-Feels us with sympathy and countless emotion for the characters.\n \n-The climax proved exceptional and will please much fans, as James Gunn forces us to feel apart of the Guardians family he has remarkably transferred from page to screen. -Phenomenal acting all around. Especially Chris Pratt as usual. Also a great performance from Kurt Russel, sending us many suspenseful thrills in the process. And don't forget the rest of the main cast in Zoe, Dave, Bradley, Michael and Vin, as there'd be no proper Guardians of the Galaxy without them.-Oh, and once again...awesome soundtrack! (Kudos to Tyler Bates on his fine work).The films lows:-Apart from the humorously action-packed, giggle worthy introduction from our little dear friend Baby Groot...The film takes on a bit of a slow start in terms of pace. Too much talking, and conversations going for slightly longer than expected, just hurt the movies initial opening feel. -A few small editing woes that can slightly annoy high standard movie analyzers.-Too much CGI at times when it wasn't needed. Don't get me wrong, the film has one of the finest computer-generated graphics universes ever. But some scenes just went a little over board in terms of laziness, as even some couches were left to be decorated and stylized by the art of technology. Still awesome work though.I hope my review has further influenced you to go into the screening with high hopes. As on behalf of James Gunn, I promise you'll rather glue yourself to the theater seat with a head held high from an overwhelmingly enjoying experience, than leave with a head held low from a poor one.My official rating: 7.9/10Thanks for reading and I hope I helped, Peace out!"}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "When going to watch Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 the main thing I was looking for was to have fun, and on that account this film sure does deliver. The characters we know and love are still just as great and a couple of new people are introduced too. However, Gamora is still the most boring character out of the Guardians, and unfortunately, Drax doesn't really do a lot except tell jokes, which are very funny admittedly. Baby Groot makes up for this and is great, if not just a little worse than the last incarnation of him we saw in the last movie. Once again the villain is not great, but he is better than Ronan in the last movie. The real flaw with this movie is that it simply isn't as good as the first one. Number 1 captured lightning in a bottle and this one attempts that and comes pretty close, but in the end, doesn't. This does not make it a bad film, however. It is still hilarious, action packed and a great deal of fun improving on some elements of the original and I recommend it to any fans of Guardians of the Galaxy.

With the intense action scenes, met with the classic one liners, tied in with the classic soundtrack your dad would dance awkwardly too, this film is definitely one for your friends and family to rave about. The acting was in parts a bit over the top and a little try-hard-like with the humor and some characters had grown a somewhat over the top personality since Vol. 1, but the hilarious lead acting of Chris Pratt as Peter and the bad*SS support of Zoe Saldana as Gamora made you not care about previously stated issues.

I can safely say GotG Volume 2 absolutely wowed me. I can't believe these bunch of lovable misfit a-holes made one of the most MATURE themed films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is visually gorgeous. The use of colour, design and the straight up imagination of the source material outstand any MCU film prior. The action is glorious and astonishing. One scene in particular, I was jaw-dropped in its entirety as direction, action-choreography and music all came together so harmoniously. And THE MUSIC! What an eargasmic soundtrack. The songs are more poetic this time around and fit the subtext of the film perfectly. The trailers gave me the feel of the first movie; a straight-up Sci-fi action-comedy with a simple point A to B plot. GotGV2 is so much MORE than this! This film is patient with its characters and there is an emphasis on growth and family. It manages to balance 7-8 characters and gives almost all of them a satisfactory emotional arc. There is so much to chew on here with the issues and motifs felt by certain characters and I applaud that! This film is vastly different and I'm glad because I just love these characters so much! They are still so fun and energetic. It's great to see the team again and how their dynamic transforms. Also I forget to mention, the film is laugh-out-loud funny! All thanks to Drax who is by far the most comedic character and put me stitches.Overall, this was both (I can't believe I'm saying this about the Guardians of the Galaxy) an emotionally dense and exciting blast. If Guardians 1 is the fast-paced Sci-Fi adventure like Star Wars was in 1977, then Vol. 2 is the deeper & richer film that takes its time to expand our beloved characters; just like Empire Strikes Back."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "The team are back and, as expected, there is no shortage in confidence or creativity. James Gunn knows how to enthral his audience. He shoots for fun and delivers it with style. It's structure fumbles, but collectively, is pretty unconventional. Which for a blockbuster is always a welcome. Where the 'Space Avengers' are lacking this time around, is in it's humour and it's character's emotional arks/developments, that made the first so heart warming. There are plenty of laughs, don't be fooled. The best come from the always dependable Rocket and Groot relationship. With Yondu of all characters, playing a part in the duo's (and perhaps the movies) biggest laugh. However, many jokes just don't land. It doesn't stifle the fun, but you may wish for a few more fresher yuks in the script. Along side that are the character motivations, which are often unconvincing and sometimes, unearned. One too many, sentimental back-story beats, that feel forced more than poignant, lower the drama. There's nothing here to match Quills relationship with his mother's final gift.Nevertheless. The team are a delight to watch, all involved are clearly having a blast (allowing us to have a blast with them) and with vol. 3 in the cards, this could prove to be one of the Marvel franchise's best trilogies."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "The Autistic Reviewers have been waiting for this movie to come out for ages now.

Michael Rooker plays him so well.

I'd heard the name thrown around a few times in conversation with hardcore comic- book fans but didn't really know anything about them before the film was released. I really liked it. I thought it was a great departure from the standard MCU formula (as much of a departure as can be had while still being part of the universe, anyway) and a genuinely exciting film with fresh characters and a fun tone.With this sequel, it feels as if the filmmakers recognised that audiences were pleasantly surprised by the first and so decided to see what else they could get away with. Something new had to be done, something that built upon the characters established by the first. Sadly, the charm of the original was lost somewhere along the way.We begin with the Guardians seemingly earning their way by working as mercenaries. Returning are Star-Lord (Chris Pratt being Chris Pratt, which is entirely fine by me), Gamora (Zoe Saldana is underutilised), Drax (Dave Bautista is hilarious, if a little one-note), Rocket (Bradley Cooper does his best with some very poor dialogue) and Groot (Fun, but would many people have even noticed if they got someone other than Vin Diesel to voice child-Groot?). After a member of this team crosses a client, they're chased across the stars before being rescued by a powerful entity who reveals himself to be Star-Lord's father (played by Kurt Russell, who channels Pratt and does a great job in doing so). We also get a scene of young Russell, which was probably the best implementation of digital deaging that I've seen in film, and yet I still couldn't help finding it a little weird. Until I can't tell at all that it's computer-generated, I don't think I like it. The ultimate unnecessity (Is that a word? Should be) of said scene didn't help matters.On the topic of necessity, it really is quite frustrating when filmmakers explain a joke to the audience after telling it. It's insulting and redundant. You can understand it when Star-Lord makes a reference to Earth pop-culture and then needs to explain it to his alien friends, and you can understand where Drax, who does not understand the concept of metaphor, is concerned. Do we really need all of the other jokes to be explained to us as well, though? Ironically, the film doesn't bother explaining things that actually have importance to the plot, especially in its third act where multiple revelations are had.Other complaints? Lazy exposition, especially early on. Jokes taken way too far. Multiple instances of toilet-humour, and not cleverly done, either. Some weird line deliveries with emphasis in all the wrong places. Annoying illogic (how come space-suits can be taken off without issue, but later on a character can't get theirs off? How come one character witnesses another pinned and uses that moment to shoot at them until they fall a few metres and are pinned again, and the character this time goes to save them? What changed in the last five seconds? The situation is identical). Also some truly cringe-worthy cheesiness towards the end of the film, some of which was supposed to be sad and some funny. It wasn't at all earned. The \"sad\" stuff, specifically, was crammed so tightly into the end of the film that it barely had time to register before being capitalised upon. The worst offender, though, was a scene in which certain characters travel faster-than-light for longer than they are supposed to, resulting in what I assume was supposed to be amusing screams, facial-distortions and eye-bulges\u0085 for a while. Very Looney Tunes. And then we cut back to it, multiple times. It's really silly, and not in a good way.There are some fantastic elements and moments. The dynamic between Drax and new character Mantis is hilarious. Most of the dialogue, sans- toilet-humour, is great. The opening titles are excellent, and got my hopes up for the rest of the film (whoops). Performances are solid, music is fun, and there were some awesome shots in there. There was even a subtle 47-reference. When it comes down to it, Guardians 2 isn't a bad movie. It just isn't a good one.Five post-credits scenes (not exaggerating) is probably a little much, too.http://alexfalzon.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2/ - for spoilers (and more reviews)"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "I saw Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 last night on the Xtreme screen at Hoyts Riccarton and I was utterly pleased with the work James Gunn has done for this film. There is no dearth of unapologetic humor in this film and after a certain point of time even the strong speakers of the cinema hall could not douse one of my friends' maniacal laughter. I was personally vouching for the more serious moments in the film because that's when I could clearly hear what the characters were saying. Otherwise when there was even the slightest hint of comedy, this guy (my friend) used to start laughing like the most hysterically loud hyena that has ever walked on this planet.In this film we get a better insight into the complexities of Star- Lord's dad and realize that he is not exactly what he seems to be. We also get a better idea of Yondu's character. I wish Marvel made a spin-off film that intricately depicted the culture and traditions of the Ravagers. They are such an exquisite group of space -pirates. I also felt sorry for Nebula and I wish the Avengers manage to conquer Thanos as fast as possible although knowing how powerful Thanos is, it will take quite sometime to bring Thanos down.We get to see Stan Lee in this film, not once, but two times. And the Marvel tradition of having post-credits scenes is maintained in this film. There are a plethora of post-credits scenes and I am eager to find out how significant Sylvester Stallone's character turns out to be in the future editions of the Marvel films. It would be awesome to see Doctor Strange and the Avengers team up with the Guardians to fight their most important battle . We got amazing seats for this film.

It's safe to say the world fell in love with them right there and then, and now they're back in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the fifteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.With the Guardians of the Galaxy, consisting of Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel), renowned as heroes and hired to defend the galaxy, it's not long before they find themselves on the run again. The trials and tribulations they face along the way pushes their relationships to new limits, all while Quill discovers the truth behind his parentage.While others moan that the MCU is becoming quite tiresome, I can't help but feel that it seems fresher than ever, particularly when they can break away to something as different as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. While it may not spring as much of a surprise on its audience as the first film this sequel doesn't try to be a carbon copy, exceeding any expectations I had going in.Going from one of Marvel Studios' biggest gambles to one of their most profitable properties is some achievement for Guardians of the Galaxy, and a lot of the success they've had has to go down to James Gunn. Gunn's work on the first film drew a lot of Star Wars comparisons with the whole space opera ideology and in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Gunn has made his Empire Strikes Back, with a strong sequel full of adventure, fractured relationships and a narrative that even comes with the father/son elements.The film is much funnier than its predecessor, the jokes coming thick and fast, with Drax and Baby Groot getting the lions share of them, and Gunn really does knock it out of the park with both the visual and verbal pop culture references. That doesn't mean the film's narrative is sacrificed in any shape or form mind, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 going on to become one of the more personal and emotional films within the MCU. One of the best things about the first film was the awesome soundtrack the film played out to. Like I've said already though, this isn't a carbon copy so they don't just pick random songs because they sound cool alongside an action sequence. The songs really do excel the film at times, Come A Little Bit Closer, Father and Son and The Chain being the stand-outs this time round. Oh, and Mr. Blue Sky deserves a special mention for playing over the best opening title sequences ever, and you'll find it hard to disagree when you see it for yourself.Coming to the performances, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sees the fine ensemble cast return along with the addition of some very welcome new cast members. Chris Pratt leads the cast with copious amounts of charisma as Peter Quill embarks on a journey into his parentage, Zoe Saldana really does hone in on the fierceness of Gamora whenever she feels like it, Dave Bautista is, once again, hilarious as Drax, his laugh being one of the most infectious you'll hear in any film and the stellar vocal performance from Bradley Cooper as Rocket is one of the highlights of the film.Michael Rooker and Karen Gillan return as Yondu and Nebula respectively, getting more to sink their teeth into this time round and each of them provides the film with some of its more prevalent heartbeats. There's also the new additions to the cast that come in the shape of Kurt Russell as Ego, a cosmic being and Quill's father, and Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Ego's empathic assistant. Russell just oozes the same charisma as Pratt so no surprise they seem to go hand-in-hand as father and son, and Klementieff does a great job in selling the innocence of Mantis as well as showing fine comedic qualities, mainly in her scenes alongside Bautista.As expected with these big budget superhero films now, the visual effects look stunning and in the case of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, they play a major part in making these films feel so detached from the rest of the MCU. The vibrant colours add even more energy to the already electric action sequences, turning the film into even more of a thrilling ride in the process. I could honestly sit and type for hours on end regarding how much I loved Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 but rather than do that, I'll just go and see the film again and again because this film has so much to give.

It has built on a wonderful, tongue in cheek and yet surprisingly refreshing original. The original I approached with skepticism, a raccoon, a tree, a blue woman, a pale hulk and a rising \"chisel jawed\" A-lister, amalgamating to save the universe. I own that mistake, for as we all know now it was one of the most refreshing films in the Marvel cinematic experience. This skepticism for the original was almost echoed by knowing the apparently insurmountable objective of expanding the original concept without it parodying itself into oblivion. Once again I was surprised, if not elated at the achievement of the direction, story, the cast and visuals. It is as hammed up as a Christmas pantomime, yet the humour, blatantly obvious at times treats you to almost audience participation. It feels as if you are turning the page of your favourite comic, hoping that you know the next panel in the storyboard and being relieved, at the satisfaction of the well-conceived twist and turn or equally satisfied by the predicted character nuance based response. These are family, you are a guardian of the galaxy recruit. The tongue firmly planted in the proverbial cheek for most assaults on the emotions, it manages to largely avoid groans of soft story writing and delivery by well timed obtuse interjections. Just when you are about to groan at some saccharine infused moment you find are laughing out loud as someone blows the sentimentality out of the water. Prepare to laugh, and laugh a lot which serves to put you off guard for the inevitable emotional polarity shifts, when the rewards for great character development gives rise to losses and strains. You probably can guess the story, you probably will be three comic pages away from knowing the story, but it is with satisfaction these unveil themselves in the crafted art, complimented but not obscured by stunning visuals, amazing special effects and fantastically incorporated soundtrack. Let's face it! It is a must see for those that immerse themselves in the Marvel universe it will satisfy all your hopes for it. For the easter egg hunters. Happy bountiful Easter! For the not so familiar with the comic genre experience on screen. BUY GOTG1, watch it and enjoy and see this before it leaves the big screen.

It requires a huge amount of exposition to set up Ego (Kurt Russell) as the God like father of Peter and the plans he has for his son now he has found him.The second hook involves a race called The Sovereign who also end up hunting down the Guardians. This is all incredibly messy as the chess pieces are forcibly moved into place to swell out the structure and give us the ending we all want.The film looks great and all the cast turn up...this was not phoned in. The charisma of the leads and the use of Baby Groot for humour keeps momentum going but it just feels like the wheels spinning faster but going nowhere.

Last night's particular session had quite a few online bookings and as always there was along queue full of people on the night. I got in early (as usual) to guarantee a premium position for such a movie. Movies that I am willing to pre-book need to be viewed in the best seating or the overall experience and satisfaction will be hindered.Like with any movie that is associated with Marvel Studios, comes its inherited \"hype\" and \"excitement\" with this film being no different. Director James Gunn has really made a name for himself directing the previous Guardians of the Galaxy and a confirmed sequel to this year's second iteration. His cinematic career does not have a large array of successful movies by his name but the Guardians of the Galaxy movies remain the pinnacle of Gunn's directing career and that is nothing to be ashamed of (they're great movies!)I cannot lie, based off the movie trailer and my experience with the first film I was expecting Gunn and Marvel Studios to follow suite with a fun, humour filled experience and it did just that. From the very outset we were provided a little bit more on the history of Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) and exactly how he came about his existence. The first film I felt deliberately hid from the fact he was only half human, not informing the public to his other heritage. It felt great to finally uncover the mystery and secrets behind Quill's upbringing and rightful \"biological\" father.Immediately after that opening scene we are thrusted straight into a familiar line-up and setting with fellow Guardians: Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and (Vin Diesel) Baby Groot joining Quill in tackling an inter-dimensional being, as their duty. Accompanied by some soothing and scene setting 80's music the battle takes place, but the focus not on the fight but rather refreshing the viewers on the character's relationships and chemistry. Throughout the movie we are re-acquainted with Nebula (Karen Gillan) and Yondu (Michael Rooker) and may I say I'm so glad that in GOTG2 they were given more screen time and backstory, absolutely loved their characters in the first film. We are also greeted by cameo appearances from Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone that add to the prestige and class of this movie. Director Gunn chose to include explaining the complex relationship that transpired between sisters Gamora and Nebula; foreshadowing a larger turn of events in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) perhaps? Time will tell all, but nonetheless I appreciated that it was explained in more detail. The fun factor and humour; because there was a lot of it was included definitely at the right times. Drax and Mantis (played by Marvel newcomer Pom Klementieff) had a playful connection at trying to understand one another and as always Rocket and Quill clashing with one another made for good viewing. Baby Groot's adorable inclusion meant for many scenes showcasing exactly how innocent and cute saving the galaxy can be and Marvel did well at portraying Groot in such a light. After the movie reached its conclusion it was so disappointing seeing so many \"fans\" walking out upon the beginning of the credits! Almost as if they hadn't realized this was a Marvel movie which, appreciates their post-production scenes and there were a massive 5 in this movie! That's right folks, 5 different scenes and one very interesting in particular setting the scene for the next installment. My only surprise was no visual mention of infamous destroyer, Thanos (Josh Brolin) although there were many verbal exchanges featuring the character. Do I think this movie will go on to win awards and accolades? I think so. Do I think this movie was an awesome and appropriate sequel to the first? Absolutely!Therefore my score for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a:9/10"}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "The first Guardians of the Galaxy was a welcome breath of fresh air. After being swamped with comic-movies obsessed with the end of the world and setting up whatever was to come in the next 80 movies or so - here was a movie dedicated to giving audiences something unique and fresh and entertaining for entertainment's sake (this coming from a viewer who has recently come to resenting the comic-book movie genre as a whole, mind you).For the most part, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 retains the fun of the original. The special effects are dazzling, the humor is sharp, and the set-pieces are exhilarating. The opening action sequence over the credits alone is terrific. So off the top it's pretty great. The expansion of the Guardians' world allows for a wealth of truly inventive design.However, the film spends a lot of time answering questions raised in the first film, rather than telling a unique story with its characters (which I thought the first film did beautifully). Peter Quill isn't given a whole lot to do in the film, and funnily enough, his journey throughout the film feels the most underdeveloped. As far as the plot is concerned, not to get into spoilers, Quill almost feels like an afterthought - simply because there is so much going on. Rooker and Cooper as Yondu and Rocket, respectively, steal the show - providing some of the most entertaining moments of the film as well as probably the most emotionally engaging relationship of the many. The cast are game and give it their all, and their energy really breathe life into their characters, but it's hard for the film to convey the notion of a rag-tag bunch of misfits becoming a family when they're all apart from each other for so much of the film.Although, not to get into spoilers, the film ends on a rather somber note - which I didn't expect and I admire the film for doing so. It commits wholeheartedly to a certain character beat and makes it work for the story. That's all I'll say.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is by no means a bad film - not even average. It's solid. Truly. But coming off the heels of the original, it narrowly misses it's mark. Our hero isn't given much of an arc, the characters are separated from each other for the bulk of the film, and it's a little too concerned with addressing unanswered questions from the original. That being said, the film retains the briskness, the fun, edge and unusual sense of humor that made the previous film so memorable - just enough that most is forgiven."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "A couple of months after the events of Vol 1. the Guardians of the Galaxy have been hired by an alien population to defend their world. Despite a successful job, a disagreement between the Aliens and the Guardians puts the team in danger. That is when Ego (Kurt Russel) comes to rescue them and reveals himself as a celestial being and Peter Quill's father.Despite having every reason and possibility to fail and become a complete spectacle mess, \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2.\" is another gem in Marvel's crown of wonderfully diverse films and another reason for their utter mastery in the genre.Once again we have a film that despite being a gigantic, out-of-control production, it represents good cinema and respectful storytelling. As in all of their recent films, Marvel has embraced the notion of telling stories and giving artists the possibility to realize their vision. Vol 2. has its problems and, as said above, they could have made the film a complete disaster, but once again thanks to the brilliant Marvel philosophy, the film is held together by the addictive passion and heart that is embedded in these characters by James Gunn. By starting on character and emotions and by worrying about telling a heartfelt story first Marvel has just made another great piece of blockbuster cinema.The film goes in many directions, some very welcome some unwarranted. There are many story lines being developed at once, there are some inconsistencies in exposition and mythology, the molding of tones isn't always seamless, some visual and world building ideas don't really pay off the way they should: the whole film is slightly uneven and there isn't a solid balance to all of these elements. Yet, when it comes down to it, it does not matter in the overall experience exactly because of what Gunn does with these characters.He manages to infuse such heartfelt emotion in these people that the problems there might be in the structuring of plot or mythology take a second place to all of the glorious, entertaining material being presented to you. Gunn takes us on a tour de force of character archs here, everyone of them is given a dynamic that is developed throughout the whole duration of the film. The surprises hit you, every emotional beat hits its mark, every laugh delivers.There is a beautiful variety of emotions that you are taken through and it is always such a pleasure to see a director tackle both comedy and drama to these emotional heights and deliver on both effectively. There are so many relations new and old that are developed and all of them give the audience a different flavor, probably the best one remains for me the one between Gamora and Quill or Gamora and Nebula.Then to top all of the heartfelt storytelling off, Gunn spices the whole picture with an incredible variety of quirkiness, great music and stunning action sequences that almost always manage to enhance the conflict between the characters. The space battles might still be a weak point of his, but it is hard not to be taken into the seamless, amazing work of the visual effects team.\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" is a beautiful, touching picture filled with powerful emotions and breathtaking laughter and entertainment, one that is so good at doing what is does that it overcomes its flaws and doesn't let the spectacle overcome the heart of the film."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "Missing a lot of the fun that the first Guardians had. Felt the story meandered and plodded along for the most part.Had a few moments, but felt more like it was filmed as an omnibus TV episode than a fully realised block-buster.The underlying father motif gave the film a little more weight in the feels department(there was a woman further down my row who was balling her eyes out, a complete blubbering mess), but it all seemed a little uneven in the way it played out and the way the story was handled.Not terrible, but not great either. A bit meh. A mixed bag for me.6 \u2013 6.5 trash pandas."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "The first film was a massive surprise when it launched, even the actors were unsure of how the movie would be received, and feared it was going to be marvels first real flop in the new age of superhero movies.But as we all know, it wasn't a flop, it was a surprisingly entertaining and fun film that was so easy to fall in love with. The characters, the universe, the effects, the story, it was all good.Personally i have seen more or less every single American superhero movie that has ever been made, with a few exceptions here and there, but hard to say which movies i might have missed, i even saw \"The Phantom\" and \"The Masters of the universe\" when they released back in the day.But just to clear something up here and now. Those two films i just mentioned, is not among what i call good films. What i consider to be some the best superhero films made to this date is (not in any particular order) Batman (1989), Batman Begins (2005), The Dark Knight (2008), Superman (1978), X-men (2001), Logan (2017), The Avengers (2012), Deadpool (2015), Spiderman 2 (2004), The incredibles (2004). Guardians of The Galaxy (2014).There are more, i just don't want to use up all my 1000 words here listing movies i like. It's just for reference.Anyways. Guardians of the galaxy 2 is not on my list of best superhero movies of all time I'm afraid, no matter how adorable baby groot is, it simply wasn't enough. This movie is a pure effect bonanza from start to finish, and it looks absolutely gorgeous, no doubt about that. The pacing isn't too bad either, the music score is amazing. But...Yes, *sigh*. The movie lacks direction. It is sort of a mess, and i have to be one of the bringers of bad news, but the movie isn't bad though, it just didn't live up to it's predecessor. It wouldn't be the first time in history that ever happened, but still.Except for the main villain, this movie is basically almost the same as the first film, not much new to see here to be honest. It feels recirculated, like the writers just thought: Oh hey, they like the first film, let's just give them more of that.Some times, this tactic works, if you write it correctly, and add enough new stuff go along with it. But they almost fell in the \"The Force Awakens\" trap here.The big laughs are far apart, most of the jokes are just mildly \"gigglingy\" (new word *patent pending*), and the movie suffers because of it. But there are some moments in the film that are truly awesome and lifts the spirits, as it can become dull at times. Incredible actually, when you think of how much is going on in this film, at any given moment.Kurt Russel is one of those \"awesome things\". He is the one that lifts this movie up a nudge, his performance and presence makes all the difference in this film. And if you are a Kurt Russel fan like me, well this movie is a lot more easy to enjoy. Snake Plissken never let's me down ^^Anyways, if you are just going to hang out with some friends and just enjoy some laughs and watch some CGI extravaganza on display, this movie has you covered for the most part. But don't expect anything like the original. I'm sad to say they didn't achieve greatness this time.6/10 - Fair"}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "I don't know if I like this one more or less than the first one. The story felt scaled down if you think about how \"Vol. 1\" was. Or maybe I shouldn't say scaled down. It was more centered on one thing. So, don't go in expecting a sequel that's more epic or just bigger/grander in general. Sure, the spectacle and the humor is still there. You will get your money's worth because of those things. But, the actual story line is a little different and not very common with these type of films. It might be disappointing for some or it might be great for others. I had a good time with it though.I wasn't expecting the movie to go to some places and the surprises were pretty good. I love the characters. Baby Groot was the one I wasn't completely sold on. I'm not the biggest fan of the idea that he is a baby in this one. Most of the jokes hit home, some minor ones felt a little too much. Don't worry, there are more good jokes than bad ones. I did laugh plenty of times. Drax was really good in this and so was Michael Rooker's Yondu. Chris Pratt delivers. He gets to have more of a dramatic role, but he still doesn't forget to have fun. I felt that Zoe Saldana's Gamora didn't stand out so much this time around. She was still playing the character well though. Mantis was one of the stand outs this time. The humor and charisma she brings to the table was fantastic. Stallone was underutilized. It was weird seeing him in it at first. It was like, \"What's he doing in this movie?\". But, he was fine as a supporting character. Now how was Kurt Russell? Well, I will not spoil anything, but he was pretty much Kurt Russell. Meaning he basically played himself. But, hey! It worked. The movie is already vibrant and funny enough that having Russell in it makes perfect sense.I admire the fact that James Gunn just goes for it and makes movies that feel personal. I like that it wasn't just entirely for the laughs and that there were some serious scenes. Most of them were good, because they dared to do some unexpected things. They also helped explore the characters even better. Although those serious/dramatic scenes usually followed up a scene that was ridiculous and fun, so the transition didn't feel smooth enough. I hope you understand what I mean. For example; We get a pop song and everyone's firing blasters and then the next second the music gets very melodramatic and someone is talking about sad feelings. What I'm trying to say is that the tones were very jumpy sometimes. There's of course the \"Fast & Furious\" thing about them stating they're a family. I didn't buy it actually. As friends? Yes, of course. But, saying they are a family is stretching it. That's probably my biggest negative. And the finale wasn't the greatest. I missed the presence of a lot of characters from the first movie. Maybe they'll show up in a sequel down the line.I may have worded this review out too much by now. I'm sorry about that. Basic point is that the Marvel Cinematic Universe hasn't hit a dead spot yet. They are still bringing us entertaining and surprisingly fresh stories. This is a pretty easy watch and the plus is that you might get some nice emotional parts here and there. Go in with a fresh mind. It's weird, I know. But, the characters all feel alive in this strange galaxy.

When it's discovered that Rocket secretly stole several batteries for himself, the Sovereign send a fleet of drones to attack the Guardians' ship, the Milano. Drax going at back of ship shooting enemy's little drones that's great action scene giving Bautista something to do more he is in the all film but in fist he hasn't got much action scenes to do but anyway he does a lot in this film. I Like that Action Scene a lot more it was fun, they crashed into some planet nearby planet, where Ego (Kurt Russell) character appears in all movie with along side with new character Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and single-handed destroys all the drones. After revealing himself as his father, Ego invites Quill accompanied by Gamora and Drax, to his home In Moments you have Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) we all know he is Pain in butt in first film but in this they changed his character better in moment scene with Stakar Ogord / Starhawk (Sylvester Stallone) one of my Favorite Actors of all time. him and Michael Rooker Played each another Cliffhanger(1993) but in this film they both have scene together about A lifelong, high-ranking Ravager who has a history with Yondu In past with him and Starhawk sold him out he doesn't want him anymore. i am not going to share that detail what i liked about scene its strong performance i just really wish they got Sly & Michael in longer scene it's Strange because in my opinion Stallone doesn't suit for role for Guardians of Galaxy film not his type but he is their for paycheck he is not really in it maybe Director or writer's didn't give him much to do witch it's shame. About more to do and making more acting performance in film give sly to do more action alongside with Michael Rooker character i really wish that could happened. give Sly and Kurt acting again in this film they all played In One Film They Never Met Each Another Characters never did noting with them it would be cool if they scene with Sly and Kurt in this film have action fight scene or something or acting scene but anyway it doesn't happen. there were a lot of funny moments So you have many funny moments with Groot its so funny makes you laugh more. and this sequel i would say a lot more better not just because new characters or just because its new sequel all that it was just better and it was more fast Paced film it was Guardians are together the first film is great. idea of Michael Rooker Character more of good guy and he becomes character you hate in first film but in this you start to like him a lot great funny jokes makes you laugh out of you ass out of seat. there is something you should not miss towards at end of film there mid post-credit scenes and ending to it never miss something i never wanted to share. 10 out 10 its worth fun watching sequel of all of time i would say its a lot more better first film."}, {"score": "1/10", "review": "I feel like a drone. Every year Marvel comes out with its new set of movies and every year like drones we all go out to see them. And for this reason Marvel makes tons of $$$ without any quality improvement or originality, because as drones, we all just gobble it up. It's like we have been given a command: \"This year you will see the following movies and not hold them to any standard, kapeesh!!\" Marvel movie story lines have been declining while at the same time special effects and better actors getting hired has been increasing. Like how winning an Oscar now lands you a role in a super hero/big budget production rather than another artistic role: Brie Larson in Captain Marvel (and the horrible Kong), Lupita Nyong'o in Star Wars (ok, that's not Marvel, but still a huge franchise.), Jared Leto as the Joker (DC, I know), but you get the picture. This creates a conundrum in our heads: good acting, great special effects, bad story writing, so, hmmmm.......does this mean that I liked it? Should I go with the flow and say I liked it, because critics aren't gonna diss a movie that's sure to make $$$ and I don't wanna seem like a killjoy or shame myself in front of my firends? You know, I'll see the next Marvel movie and then decide.And so this year, the cycle begins with us giving our money to Guardians of the Galaxy V2. Expect nothing more than what the trailer has to offer. Or see the first one again and it'll be the same as seeing V2, you'll just save money. The story does advance with Kurt Russell starring as Starlord's dad. Kind of a rehash of \"No/Luke....I am your father.\" It's good when they hire good actors. Make-up and special effects are great. But in all, I wouldn't use the words \"enjoyable\" or \"exciting.\" I'll just say, \"Ritual completed, onto the next superhero movie.\"Hey I'm a victim here nonetheless. I'm not criticizing people for seeing Guardians, as I also did, but I'm getting to get critical of us who every year, dish out our money for these superhero movies, which are in fact not becoming any better in quality, and studio execs thinking that they are creating masterpieces because of the gross $$$, hence thereforth making no extra effort to make a better movie. So see it, or stay at home and stare at the wall...it's up to you.

Based on the Marvel Comics characters, this film still retains most of the fun and action that made the original such a hit.A short time after the events of the first film, the Guardians of the Galaxy, lead by Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), are still travelling through space on their usual adventures. One day, after escaping from a barrage of enemies, the Guardians meet a mysterious man named Ego (Kurt Russell), who claims to be Peter's true father. Ego takes Peter to his homeworld, where he intends to live with and be a true father to him. However, the rest of the Guardians feel something doesn't seem right and investigate what Ego's true intentions really are.Filled to the brim with dry humour, great action, a catchy soundtrack, a funny Stan Lee cameo, and the rest of the Marvel film staples, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a worthy follow-up, although it does lack some of the freshness and surprise that was in the 2014 original. I particularly enjoyed the extended character development given to characters Drax (Dave Bautista) and Yondu (Michael Rooker). Once again, though, it is Vin Diesel as (Baby) Groot who steals the show in just about every scene he is in. As to be expected, there are some post-credits scenes to stay back for, five of them to be precise.I rate it 8/10"}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "In 1997's Scream 2, movie buff Randy Meeks spelled out the \"rules\" for a sequel. While he was specifically talking about horror movies, the basic principles of these rules could easily be applied to other genres. More characters, more action pieces, higher stakes, and some kind of added wrinkle to the expected story.And what do most sequels from that era also seem to have in common? A lot of them were not well received by audiences. \"Sequels suck\" has been a popular school of thought for as long as I can remember. These days, the popularity of sequels has started trending upwards, but sometimes we still get one that follows the same old rules.Thus, we get Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.That story starts with the Guardians \u2013 Peter Quill / Starlord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper), and Baby Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) \u2013 as mercenaries for hire. After doing a job for a race of people called The Sovereign, the Guardians find themselves in trouble when Rocket steals from The Sovereign. After a chase scene straight out of The Empire Strikes Back, the Guardians \u2013 now with Nebula (Karen Gillan) in tow \u2013 find themselves stranded while Rocket makes repairs to their ship. This is where Peter's father, Ego (Kurt Russel) and his assistant Mantis (Pom Klementieff) finally catch up with the Guardians. Ego whisks Peter, Drax, and Gamora away so Peter can learn of his true lineage. Meanwhile, Yondu (Michael Rooker) has been disgraced by The Ravagers, and accepts a job from Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), head of The Sovereign to track down the Guardians and bring them to justice.As for the stakes the Guardians are up against this time, it was always going to be difficult to top the Infinity Stone story from the last movie, and it first it doesn't look like they're going to. The majority of Vol. 2 feels like a smaller and more personal story (which, keeping in mind that I haven't seen Iron Fist yet, Marvel seems to have found decent success with on their Netflix shows), but later turns out to have ramifications for the whole galaxy. I'd have preferred it if they had kept it small and focused on the family the Guardians are becoming. Especially given that the final battle scene feels overly long and drawn out for no particular reason. Not only that, but the Sovereign are among Marvel's worst villains. They're not evil, they're just pompous douchebags who only go after the Guardians because Rocket stole from them. That's actually quite a shame, as the rest of the battle scenes are a lot of fun. Peter's music collection again provides the backdrop, and there's something whimsical about seeing explosions and bodies falling while you're listening to some classic pop music from the '70s and '80s. The best of these is perhaps a scene where Yondu effortlessly takes out a number of mooks with a flying arrow that he seems to control by whistling.While all the Guardians \u2013 except Groot \u2013 get some great character moments here, the focus is really on Peter, Gamora, and the new additions to the team. Mantis was an absolute delight, and her budding relationship with Drax is something that deserves a lot more screen time come Vol. 3. Karen Gillan gives perhaps the movie's best performance as Nebula, who is dealing with issues from her childhood thanks to her relationships with Thanos and Gamora. I spent the movie hoping she'd find the peace she was looking for, but knowing that if she did, it wasn't going to come in the way she clearly wanted it to.The weak link in the acting, surprisingly, is Kurt Russel. Ego's entire story gives him a whole range of emotions to go through, and Russel just doesn't convince me on any of it. From a man I know is capable of so much better, this felt like him just cashing a paycheck. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a fun movie, overall, and if that's all you're looking for from it \u2013 if all you want is an amusing space adventure with characters you (mostly) already know, with some great action and musical sequences \u2013 then you're probably going to have a great time with this movie. But if you were hoping it would recapture the magic of the first movie, or show a little something more, you'll probably come out feeling somewhat disappointed.For my full review of this and other movies, visit my website at theblogfather.co.nz"}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "One of my favorite scenes from original Guardians of galaxy was the escape from the Xandar jail. There were some great comic moments, good teamwork, genuine moments of curiosity how the team will be able to break free. When you replace a good script with CGI explosions, you don't get the same impact. It is disappointing to see that after more than 10 movies later, Marvel still relies on the good old \"explosions and punches solve the problem\" technique. I understand the logic behind action in Avengers but I have never been a fan of cheap looking CGI climaxes, be it in X-men Apocalypse, Thor movies or Suicide squad. There is a reason that The Winter Soldier is still considered to be the best MCU movie so far with far more humane action and restrained with such great quality on television and Netflix we are getting, anything less than extra ordinary seems sub-standard.The movie in one world is about Parenting, more specifically about Peter Quill finding his father and how other events unfold which endangers the entire galaxy. Movie starts with some real promise, story lines seems to be really intriguing in the beginning when the team splits up and go on their own individual adventures. What follows in 2nd half of the movie is less than satisfactory in terms of storyline, the novelty factor wanes off and it starts feeling like any other generic Marvel movie where even world ending stakes don't feel much.That being said, it is quite a fun movie, better than a lot of movies proclaiming to be comedies. Drax, baby Groot, Rocket, even the newly added characters such as Mantis make sure you are laughing out loud many times in this movie. Even if you are not a fan of Marvel's movie making rule of 4 jokes per minute, this movie's humor level is much better than anything seen so far, it even beats Avengers in that regard.It is definitely a watch, you will have a great time during its 130 minute runtime, its the hollow feeling once you have left the theatre which is the main concern."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "I was lucky to get an early showing of this film. First of all, CGI and production team are perfect as always. The introduction to the film is the best thing you'll see.

Every time you hear him laugh you'll laugh with him. His jokes are too funny! The characters development have improved, Draxs being Draxs, Rockets using more of his traits and gadgets and Gamora and Peters relationship have increase. The film was going great but the story goes extremely wild and very far fetch. When you see it you'll be like WTF?!??
