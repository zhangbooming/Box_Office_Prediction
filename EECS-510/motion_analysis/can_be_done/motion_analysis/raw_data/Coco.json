[{"score": "10/10", "review": "Yes, Pixar Animation Studios has done it again -- their latest release, Coco (2017), is not only a return to form, but also manages to be their best feature yet. From 1995 all the way up until 2010, Pixar knocked it out of the park with every release, save for Cars (2006) and maybe A Bug's Life (1998). However, after Cars 2 (2011), it seems every release of theirs has been bad or mediocre, except of course for 2015's extraordinary Inside Out (2015). Luckily, Coco (2017) manages to be the second great Pixar movie since Toy Story 3 (2010), and hopefully a return to form for good this time. All I will divulge about the plot is that it follows a boy named Miguel and his dog traveling into the Land of the Dead. From there, the story takes you to startling visual, entertainment, and emotional heights that no Pixar movie, no kids' movie, and very few \"adult\" movies have ever taken you. Yes, this is even more emotional than Up (2009) and Inside Out (2015) -- both of those films moved me to tears, but never hit me as hard as this one did. It touched something deep within my soul, and unlike most emotional films where my eyes will water a bit, in this one I began to openly weep. It was an emotional catharsis like I've never experienced before. Aside from the poignant elements, the film also manages to be enormously entertaining, with exhilarating sequences that reaches levels of fun Pixar hasn't reached since Monsters, Inc (2001) and The Incredibles (2004). They use the visually gorgeous Land of the Dead they have created to their full advantage, to provide a rollicking adventure that combines imagination and entertainment brilliantly. The other thing I should mention is the score, which is, by far, the best Pixar score I have ever had the pleasure of listening to -- yes, even better than Finding Nemo's (2003), Up's (2009), and Inside Out's (2015). I suppose that shouldn't come as a surprise, considering this is the most musical movie Pixar has ever created, but nevertheless was one of the many, many memorable aspects. In Conclusion, my favorite Pixar movies up until this point have been Toy Story (1995), Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), WALL-E (2008), and Up (2009), with Monsters, Inc. (2001), Ratatouille (2007), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Inside Out (2015) not far behind. I have been disappointed by their seemingly endless sequels this decade, and by the fact that even their originals (Brave (2012) and The Good Dinosaur (2015)) have been okay at best. Even Inside Out (2015), though I love it, is still better at delivering an important message to children than it is being its own story. But with Coco (2017), Pixar has nailed it. It brought me back to childhood nostalgia of watching Pixar classics like Finding Nemo (2003) and Toy Story (1995); the fun, the adventure, the laughs, and the tears. This is what a Pixar movie should be, this is what a kids' movie should me, this is what any movie should be, and it is truly one of my favorite movies of all time.RATING: 10.0/10.0"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Im Mexican and all i can say is Thanks you Pizax,I just saw this movie and i just remembered all my childhood with my grandparents, Mexico was represented beautifully,the music, the colors.

Or, perhaps I wanted to see Pixar really get back on the game. Go beyond Up, and make a complete movie that was as beautiful as the first 20 minutes of Wall-E.I got my wish. This is the movie I wanted Pixar to make, once again. A movie about what family means. A movie about the choices we make, and the roads not taken. This is a stunning work of art. It'll move you from happiness to tears, from memories of the past to the joy of the future. To understanding, to remembrance. To the joys and pains of being alive.I can't even begin to imagine how Pixar made a movie about life and death that is so colorful, so absorbing, so poignant, and so approachable for kids, and with so many layers upon layers upon layers of meaning and significance for adults.To watch Coco is to love Coco, and to remember the Cocos in your life that are no longer among us.Thank you, Pixar."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Let me start of by saying that as Mexican born and resident, I found this movie very respectful and honest about our culture. So, watch it without any guilt! \"COCO\" tells the history of Miguel, a music- loving boy trapped on a shoe maker family that happens to hate music for generations, this is because his great-great grandmother was left by a musician. After breaking his family rule of \"no music\" he embarks on an adventure through the world of the dead. This is Disney at its finest, a powerful movie with a powerful message, even though I found it to be more on the WDAS territory, it is clearly a Pixar trademark. I cannot speak about the voice acting in general since I watched in Spanish, but for that matter the cast was very well developed here in Mexico and they made a wonderful job on that department. Gael Garcia's did same voice as in the English version at least I can say that he did a very nice job as Hector. The only thing I didn't like about the movie (And the reason I subtract 1 star out of the 10 maximum) was the third act, which I found It to be very clich\u00e9 with a very, very old trope found in lots of movies and even regular TV shows and cartoons (I ain't going to spoil anything), but don't worry, it is compensated with the rest of the movie which I found it be very clever and emotional all the way through. And of course! As an old Disney-Pixar tradition this movie is one hell of a Tear-Jerker so don't forget to bring your tissues to the theater. I'm sure you and your family will enjoy this movie so go see it, you won't regret it."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "\"Coco\" is unquestionably a movie about bridging gaps. In the film, a literal bridge of marigold petals links the Worlds of the Living and the Dead for a night. In the real world, Pixar has tended a symbolic bridge with this film to link Mexicans, Chicanos (U.S.-based Mexicans and their descendants), U.S. nationals and the world via one of our most difficult shared human experiences. This isn't a movie spearheaded by Mexican artists to introduce the world to one of our beloved idiosyncrasies, like the inevitably comparable \"The Book of Life\" (a movie that I like but have far more issues with as a film fan than \"Coco\", regardless of nationality) but to simplify it as \"a culturally appropriative work by a non-Mexican\" would be to not only miss the point of the story told in it but to miss the point in its creation as well.Lee Unkrich and the team at Pixar clearly went at great lengths to not only understand the holiday itself but also how to best present it to those unfamiliar. There's also a clear effort to try and understand the culture(s) that originate, adapt and celebrate the holiday (or as much as one can \"understand\" Mexico in anything less than a lifetime). Why so much effort? What one can infer from interviews with Unkrich is that his decision to make the movie came from a place of genuine admiration and curiosity. Filtered through Pixar's famously thorough work ethic in the service of storytelling, you end up with a film fruit of both love and intelligent, hard work, clear in many of the filmmaking decisions.For those in the know, Mexican Spanish expressions are uttered without subtitles, national celebrities (or at least their skeletal avatars) appear and are paid tribute, the cultural differences between regions of Mexico are alluded to, the movie is clearly set in the modern day and respect for the country, its people and sometimes complicated family dynamics is on display. Regarding our relatives north of the border and elsewhere, the cast of the film is more Chicano than Mexican-born and the more internationally-popular term \"D\u00eda de LOS Muertos\" is as common as our preferred \"D\u00eda de Muertos\". For those complete outsiders to the holiday, its emotionality and symbolism are explained just the right amount to follow the plot yet leaving some air of mystery while Santa Cecilia is not too far from that most-familiar depiction of small, dusty colonial towns as the face of Mexico. All these compromises show that the film is intended as a message of unity and understanding. Yes, some references will definitely fly over many audiences' heads, but the Pixar magic lies in that, making some parts of the film so specific, they've managed to turn the whole universal.Mexicans, a people defined by a tug-of-war between indigenous, European, personal, global and other identities that work best when balance between them is achieved, are a prime example of the importance of finding what's universal. Our holiday dedicated to \"let's turn mourning into joy\" may seem incongruous but it comes from the observation of joy and death as being equally unifying. We're all united by knowing joy, some of it courtesy of those who've passed on. We're all united by and equal in death, to every being that's ever lived. The death of beloved ones brings us memories, their memories bring us joy, this is the essence of D\u00eda de Muertos. \"Coco\"'s noble essence, par for the course of the Pixar canon (perhaps not as bold as \"Wall-E\" or \"Monsters University\", but bold enough) is to bridge the relatively small gaps between personal passion and responsibility, Mexas and others, on the same level as those huge gaps between joy and mourning, death and life. Thanks to the respectful research and collaborations behind the film, its essence not only aligns with that of the holiday, but hopefully will complement and strenghten each other, for years to come, for every early November night that we remember... and smile."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "A Pixar's masterpiece, impeccably done in terms of research (about the Mexican culture), animation, script, musicalization, direction and production. A subtle yet charming and inspiring story; with a quality of animation worthy of an Academy Award (I wouldn't be surprised if it was one of the great winners of 2018); with an extremely powerful soundtrack; an excellent script; likable, well-developed and relatable characters; and extremely respectful of the cultural component in which the story is inspired. In short, one of the best landings of Pixar - perhaps repeating a bit its known formula, hence you can feel a \"back to basics\" in terms of the narrative, history and character development, but at the same time managing to stand out as a fresh and purposeful product that will undoubtedly give a lot to talk about."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Three words... WOW, what an amazing movie, the story starts getting better and better, such a beautiful story, with so much touching moments, amazing soundtrack, congratulations to pixar, total respect to you guys, Mexico is amazing!!! you learn so much about the Mexican culture, incredible."}, {"score": "5/10", "review": "First of all, I have always been a huge fan of Pixar. I loved nearly all of their films, except for Cars 3 and Brave (I actually thought Cars 2 was fine - don't hate me!). I am usually very open to most films and give them positive ratings despite a few flaws.With Coco, I was utterly disappointed. I was lucky enough to snag a few preview screening tickets last Friday. I went with my wife and 8 year old child. My son really liked it, but that was mostly because of the outstanding animation (some of Pixar's best animation yet) and the lead character. My wife and I both found the same flaws in this. The story is very different from what Pixar usually makes. Coco is not as childish or simple as most of their other works. The concept is guaranteed to teach children about a new culture that they might not know about. While this may sound like a huge positive, it completely ruins the film for adults who cared about the story. Almost every major plot point relies on the viewer understanding a certain amount of Spanish to know what is being said among the characters. Unfortunately, I took 4 years of French in high school and had absolutely no understanding of the Spanish language. I was confused as to exactly what was being said during the climax. A character mentions to another character some important detail about the story in Spanish (which I will avoid spoiling for you) that I had to infer for myself in order to keep up with the heavy story. I don't know if there were originally subtitles to the film or not, but my theater at least had no subtitles for English speakers. From the trailer, this film appears to be more mature and daring than a typical Pixar film. In reality, this movie is just more confusing and goes for visually stunning shots more often than it goes for emotion. This is still a good movie for kids - as opposed to a movie like The Emoji Movie - and has a few teachable moments. There is a nice and thoughtful message in this, but no real impact or emotional weight to carry it through to viewers. Think of this film as an African proverb - it offers an important life lesson, but no emotion or story to accompany it. In the end, I can't really recommend this film unless you are willing to sacrifice your standards of an engaging story and emotional impact for stunning visuals and an original concept from what used to be my favorite animation studio of all time."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Coco (2017) is an animated film co-directed by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina. It is a story set in the fictitious Mexican town of Santa Cecilia, where young Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) embarks on a journey when his passion in life and dreams are called into question by his family. All Miguel wants from this life is emulating the great and famous singer Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt) but his abuela and relatives oppose. Miguel must come to terms with his family and return back home after he disrespects the \"dia de los muertos\" tradition and a curse falls upon him, trapping him with the dead. He finds help from the deceased Hector (Gael Garcia) and members of his family like Mama Imelda (Alana Ubach) as he finds a way to express his talents and learns family history. At its core Coco is a story about passion, memory and family. Miguel follows a story arch where he must learn self value, bravery and the value of being true to one's self while remaining loyal to family, respecting tradition and remembering one's past in the form of family history. With a reputation for great storytelling, juggernauts Disney and Pixar have found a way to tell a story with such a worn arch with a new and authentic style. A lesson is learned by almost every main character as they grow and develop. Passion is pitted against tradition (and perhaps stubborn customs) and the outcome produces strong emotions on the viewer. At times the story felt carried itself with the drama and flair of a Mexican \"Telenovela\". These are some rich themes for what may be considered a \"kid's film\" but they develop organically and are never forced. However the film doesn't lack that slapstick humour or easy and quirky kid's comedy (Especially present in the playfulness of the dead characters' bones). The production team made a respectable effort preparing for the production of this film, and the results were worthwhile and evident. The film is brilliantly set in Mexico, showcasing a wide range of customs and cultural icons that made the film feel authentic. Everything from Mexican cuisine (Like tacos, tamales or \"pan de muerto\") to celebrities (Like Frida Kahlo, El Santo, Pedro Infante or Cantinflas) make an appearance. Traditional \"Mariachi\" or \"Charro\" suits and elaborate woman hairstyles are accurately represented. Mexican family culture is accurately represented from the respect towards our loving, stern and kiss filling abuelas, to that spicy and sassy personality characteristic of Mexican and Latin women. Even the idolization of popular musical icons, similar to Ernesto de la Cruz in the film, resembles the decades old fascination with the likes of actual celebrities like Pedro Infante or Jose Alfredo Jimenez. I authentically felt the story was set in a real, picturesque Mexican pueblo. Every small detail felt in place and that enhanced the story. The film understands and respects the traditions of \"dia de los muertos\" while giving it a modern twist. Despite the difficulties, and risks, that come with portraying such a rich and complex culture the film makes a much appreciated effort in introducing a side of Mexican culture that is at times neglected in favour of easy-to-go stereotypes.The film felt beautifully animated with intricate finger movements while playing a worn-out guitar or the miniscule pores and imperfections of the bones. Visually gorgeous and impressive the film makes use of a brightly coloured pallet, like with the rich orange used for the \"cempazuchitl\" flowers or the \"papel picado\" banners. The music fit perfectly with the tone used for the story and never stopped having a particularly Mexican flavour from the use of the guitar or trumpets to the \"marimba\". The score continued to set the story appropriately. Coco is carried by memorable fun moments, like Miguel's encounter with exotic Frida Kahlo, and beautiful and emotionally filled ones, such as that of the last act which grounded the story's themes of love for music and family during a scene that is sure to invoke a tear or two. Despite a few moments where it felt that the plot was driven by the oversimplified and unexplained mechanics of the curse, the film in general doesn't stop being the memorable and enjoyable experience of a familiar story executed with fresh and authentic style."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Beautiful, almost perfect, at last a movie that honors our roots and not making fun with them.

Pixar-Disney jumps out of the box, once again, and leave all the princess and fairy stories to show us the importance of family and traditions in a unique funny and colorful story. All the characters are right on point, they grow together learning from each other making it one of the most emotional and pleasing movie I've seen in a long time.

The story was a match made in Pixar heaven due to its heart wrenching and heartwarming moments. Though this story seemed a bit morbid at times, you can really tell Pixar catered this movie to adults as well as kids. The visual effects were probably my favorite in any Pixar film thus far. The amount of detail on screen at any given time was beyond belief. Also, the character development was extraordinary. Having an extensive look at each character's background not only helped you fall in love with the characters, but it was also used as a unique storytelling device. The music in this movie was great too as it paid homage to the traditional mariachi style still practiced in Mexico today. The movie even featured some songs with lyrics entirely in Spanish. Overall, I would say this movie captured the Mexican heritage to a T. The characters were memorable, the story and dialogue were exceptionally written, the visuals were gorgeous and bursting with color, and the music was festive and fun."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "\"Coco\" its the latest Disney Pixar animated film, I try not to miss that many Pixar movies and even if a few of them have escaped me I still do whatever I can do to watch them, I love a good Disney movie and \"Coco\" its no exception.I know that the gimmick this time its that it takes elements from the Mexican tradition known as El dia de los muertos (actually, it takes elements from general Mexican culture) but I cant help to feel that this is a small story that happens to take place in a huge startling world, we follow our characters through a journey that only affects them, the rest of the world does not depend on their fate but they aren't apathetic towards them, its a nice balance between a big story and a personal one. The plot isn't anything special, the world it establishes isn't special either, the characters are likable but they aren't great, except for a few of them like our main lead who carries the whole movie (as it should be), yet I wish they would have developed the rest of the family a little more or at least in a better way. The movie opens with exposition, as many modern Pixar movies do, I remember \"Moana\" doing this too, it doesn't bother me that much, I know that there's a lot to explain and to establish, so I just go along with it until it stops giving us information and tries to have actual scenes, when we get to them they are worth it. While I do like movie I will say it hits all the story beats a movie like this would, its not original, its quite predictable and melodramatic at points, but its effective, for whatever flaws it may have, never do they break the mood and they feel somewhat insignificant when compared to the wonders the film offers. The themes and subjects it plays with are familiar to me, physical death isn't the worst thing awaiting man and the pursuit of a dream will take away part of you. I was predicting where it would go and I was also awaiting for an specific moment to come, as I knew that it will be executed perfectly, and it was. I had a good time watching this, when its not being good its about as average as you can get, that goes to show how superior Pixar is to the rest, when they are not being exceptional they on the same level as their competition."}, {"score": "4/10", "review": "Honestly, I wasn't amazed or fantacised by 'Coco'. It's nowhere even near the same level as Toy Story 3, Inside Out, Up and WALL\u0095E. It went on for too long, some scenes dragged and weren't that entertaining. The first half especially was extremely dull, I literally just didn't know why I was watching the film. But the day of the dead scenes were kinda entertaining and quite a bit of fun. That was really when the film started to pick itself up a bit. The animation is spectacular and I'm glad that Pixar satisfied me with their stunning visuals, like they always do. The characters are good-fun and are people you can definitely relate to. Miguel is a great lead and when he's stuck with these skeleton-like people (I don't know what to call them, sorry!), it really is a lot of fun and entertaining. Although I didn't even enjoy Coco that much, I'm pretty sure you will, I'm pretty sure you'd like to watch it.I enjoyed this one less then Cars 3 but give it a watch, and if you don't want to, don't.

The protagonist's journey lacks actual purpose, the writers seem more focused in the real adventure that in the metaphorical one. He doesn't grow or mature.

There is an infinity of international projects that have tried to portray the Mexican culture, but in one way or another have failed miserably (some more than others), getting to see some in which we are represented even in a ridiculous and offensive . I must confess my fear that \"Coco\" would be part of this list, so I initially rejected the idea of \u200b\u200bwasting money on the ticket; but once the fear has been overcome, I have been surprised to see that from the intro of Disney, to the credits, the Mexican culture is present. I do not know if by the controversy in which he was involved or by the collaboration of Lalo Alcaraz, but the magnificent work to which Pixar has accustomed us, was pleasantly surpassed, portraying in great detail not only the mysticism that surrounds the festivity, but also other elements that are truly part of our culture (family coexistence, music, costumes, beliefs, characters, etc.). The story of a Mexican boy named Miguel who wants to be like his musical idol (Ernesto de la Cruz) even against his family, takes him to meet Hector, who becomes his companion in adventures and with whom both Miguel and us We recognize many famous people, we discover the importance of the family and the values \u200b\u200bthat identify us as people and as a nation. Although in general terms the film is worthy of being recommended for the whole family, I must clarify that some situations and ideas represented are not characteristic of that festival or have been incorporated in recent years and that the personality of some famous people has been significantly altered (I suppose with the purpose of giving a touch of comedy to the story), which is why I find it painful not to give an absolute 10. Now I understand when they qualified me with 9.9 and they told me that my work was for a 10 if not for a tiny detail, but in case the creators of Pixar read this review I will compensate them by telling our followers that if they have not gone to see it, Run to your favorite cinema! If they are Mexican they will be happy to see how they dignify our culture after so many grievances and if they are not Mexican, but want to know and understand Mexico (especially the Day of the Dead tradition) it is the most fun way to do it."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "To read my full review for Coco go to: www.havekidwillteardrop.comWhen I heard this movie was coming out, I was really excited to see it. My son's class had studied the Day of the Dead (Dia de los Muertos) in school where he learned about the history of this very important day and why it is celebrated. I was curious how Disney/Pixar would come at this because even though they always have the best intentions, some times things don't go as planned. After seeing it last night I feel like they hit it out of the park!This movie is so so full of love and color and passion. I appreciated how they explained the celebration and why it is important to people of Mexico (and beyond). The message of family, hard work and love is so strong. There is also a message of finding a way to follow your passion and if you want it you have to make it happen (although hopefully your choices will be good ones and not ones that are wrong!).The attention to detail throughout the film is incredible. When you watch various people in the movie play the guitar it is like watching a real person play. The filmmakers did their best to replicate how the fingers move and the positions they take. Attention to detail went beyond that \u2013 there is an introduction to famous Mexican heroes like Frida Kaldo and both worlds were inspired by real places the team traveled to throughout Mexico. Filmmakers collaborated with a team of cultural consultants, whose families all hail from Mexico, to weigh in on everything from character wardrobe and sets d\u00e9cor to the color palette and even dialogue\u2014encouraging a fluid blend of Spanish and English within the script in a way that required no translation. There is a long list of families in my press materials that helped with all of this as well and I felt like the film was done in such a magical yet culturally respectful way. You could really feel like this family could live next door. Or be your family.While this movie is really heart-warming there is a lot of humor too. The street dog, Dante, who Miguel befriends is hilarious and reminds me a lot of the chicken in Moana. He doesn't seem all that intelligent, will eat nearly everything, but is a loyal friend and travel companion. He might not be family, but he becomes family by the end of the film and proves that he loves as hard as Miguel. There are other fun jokes and Hector is quite a character \u2013 beloved and silly all at the same time.The voice talent in the movie is fantastic. Miguel is voiced by Anthony Gonzalez and he is wonderful. He has been playing mariachi since he was 4 years old and lends his voice to the songs his character sings. My husband doesn't really love movies that have a lot of music in them, but he felt like this had just the right amount and really loved the story line, even if it was a little bit predictable. Our son really loved it too and says all kids should see this. The directors Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina bring a really beautiful film to us and I highly recommend seeing this one with your family.

Whether near or far, we think of our loved ones and hopefully will be able to spend at least a little bit of time with them, celebrating another year of life, both its peaks and valleys. Along with this time comes another expected release from Pixar/Disney, and this year, it's \"Coco\".Up and coming young actor Anthony Gonzalez voices Miguel, a young man living in Mexico as El Dia de la Muerte approaches. Since this is the Day of the Dead, his family has gathered to honor their ancestors before them, as four generations of his family live under one roof, working their days away making shoes. Due to his great, great grandfather leaving the family to pursue music, the art form has been banned from the family itself even though Miguel has the gift within him. When he decides to defy his family and play in a talent show, he \"borrows\" a guitar from the grave of his hero, Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), but when he plays it, he finds himself amongst the dead with his ancestors in a race against time to not only get back to the Land of the Living but also help a new friend named Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal) get to see his family and not be forgotten and lost forever.I was able to take my good friend and \"sister\" to this screening, and I think she said it best as the end credits rolled: \"Pixar and all of their feels\". There will be many people (including myself) that saw the trailer for \"Coco\" and wondered if this was The House of Mouse's version of Jorge R. Gutierrez's 2014 \"The Book of Life,\" but the setting is about where those comparisons will come to an end outside of both of these films being wonderfully enjoyable. Outside of being nothing short of gorgeous visually, there is a story that goes along with those visuals that is rich, engaging, and packed full of fun and emotion along with voice talents (which also includes Gabriel Iglesias, Edward James Olmos, and Cheech Marin) that really bring the characters to life. The themes of family, love, respect for tradition, and the need for tradition are incredibly strong here co- written by Lee Unkrich (who also directed the film) that had me laughing out loud in certain points as well as getting misty in others. Running almost two hours (which seems to becoming the norm for animated features in recent years), this is yet another example of Pixar knowing their audience and delivering on it, as the screening we attended was chock full of young'uns that were both focused and well- behaved throughout this film. There will be a short film that will be shown in some theaters that is a holiday special from the cast of \"Frozen,\" but we did not see it at our particular screening.If you are looking for a film this holiday season that is a lock for being enjoyable by each and every member of YOUR family, \"Coco\" is right up your alley. Whether it is fun for the kids as they follow Miguel's journey back to HIS family or an engaging story that the adults and everyone in between can both identify with and enjoy, this is another home run for Disney and Pixar!"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "LIKES: The Animation: Pixar/Disney are the kings of animation, and they have proved themselves again in this CGI masterpiece. Coco's characters are dynamic, presented in so many forms that give the family a spectrum of characters. Despite a majority of the cast looking carbon copied version of skeletons, Pixar managed to inject subtle differences to make primary and secondary characters stand out. The living members also got the anatomy altered as well, going so far to represent all stage of life (i.e. old and senile, young and energetic, and even pregnant). Past designs, the movement itself is incredibly detailed. The subtle gestures in walking/running, the accurate capture of facial gestures for conversation, and more importantly the incredible finger motions of Miguel and cast playing the guitar. A statement of Pixar having incredible attention to detail wasn't kidding, because this thing was gorgeous. Spirit animals: One stand out feature of this movie are the cool spirt animals that inhabit the land of the undead. The flying jaguar, while one of the most outstanding displays, is only the tip of the iceberg, and these creatures are sprawled out in the world. I found it cool to see the creativity of blending common animals into a pi\u00f1ata like creation, each feature designed to add finesse and flare to mix and represent the culture of Mexico. The Culture: Disney movies always have a way of capturing an element of the real world. Coco's theme is all about the Mexican culture and the various customs that we as viewers only have an inkling of understanding. Pixar managed to bring that culture to life not only in design, but in the story, they have developed in this tale. Their belief in the afterlife is the foundation this tale is built on, allowing other things like soap operas, fiestas, food, and the western film culture. And within all these elements are the important customs of family, the passion of music, and the pursuit of dreams through hard work. All of these are beautifully integrated into the mix, occasionally crossing into cheesy territory, to craft a very stirring tale. The Music: By far the biggest element for me though, has to be the music of Coco. Disney is always spectacular with their soundtracks, but Coco stands out to me as one of the more unique sets of music to come out of the studio. Instead of grandiose symphonies, or Oscar designed symphonies, Coco's music is all about representing the musical culture of Mexico. Each song builds around the acoustic guitar as the primary instrument in its calm, yet vibrant strings. Such a simple instrument packs an emotional kick, especially once the supporting instruments and the voice bellow out to unleash the pent-up emotion of our characters. The songs build into the story, and are used as the primary tools for accomplishing Miguel's goals and represents a variety of artistic styles this culture has. It's dynamic, it's fun, and its relevant to the story, all big points in this reviewer's eyes. DISLIKES:The opening short: While separate, the opening number is still part of the show. Olaf's frozen adventure, while cute, was just another compilation of short songs to refresh Disney's cash cow for the last few years. Sure, some of the songs are powerful (the ending in particular), and the message tugs at my strings, but it lacked a lot of sustenance for just more songs. Thank goodness Coco's music redeemed this quality. More with the creatures: I like the spirit animals, I just didn't like how much of a background they were. With such cool concepts, you think that Disney would have found a way to capitalize on these monsters' involvement in the world whether it be searching for clues, chasing our heroes, or having more bang in the final setting. Even without their integration, the studio downplayed their powers a bit, showing inconsistencies with the potential they developed in these creatures. Lackluster Excitement: Thinking back to Pixar's previous works, there are usually those edge on the seat moments that have you questioning the fate of the heroes (Toy Story, Incredibles, even Cars). Coco not so much for me. The movie stays pretty safe, with predictable antics, calm action scenes, and a final obstacle that didn't do much for me in the suspense role. This film blows the cultural relevance out of the water, yet it still missed its potential for a complete package without the action. Many Book of Life elements: This movie stands out on its own in so many concepts and the songs are much more original. Yet, there is a lot of this movie based off of Book of Life, and in many cases less vibrant and unique than the predecessor. In my opinion, I felt the Book of Life was the more exciting of the two tales and I like this design more than the scale this one took. Still, Coco holds a lot of finesse that the Book failed to have. The VERDICT: Coco is certainly one of the more culturally relevant Pixar movies to come out of the studio. It's design and animation are gorgeous, the creativity is on point, and so much of it is packed with tasteful portrayals of this beautiful culture. Yet, it still has a few shortcomings for me to make it a perfect movie. They dropped some of the potential they built up and the excitement element could have been amped up with more struggles as well. When all is said and done though, Coco is by far one of the better films to hit the theaters this November and I strongly encourage many to flood the theaters and scope it out. And for those with little ones obsessed with Frozen, this movie is only going to be better for them. My scores: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.5"}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "I was looking forward to seeing this movie since I had seen Book of Life which I really liked. After seeing Coco, I thought it had a good and touching story, but very similar to Book of Life and therefore very easy to end up comparing one to the other.In general I liked Book of life better since it had more humor and found songs and music to be better. Still a good movie worth watching."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "The movie is OK is pretty colourfull but it lacks on orginality at the end of the plot because they recycled the same plot/scenes from monster inc of zootopia at the end, very disappointing with that They should called pueblito maxico or cempas\u00fachil(the flowers displayed on the film are called), coco is a stupid name, not a common"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "I should talk as much about the short film Olaf's Frozen Adventure, as much as I'm going to talk about Coco. I'm use to Disney and Pixar showing a short animated film before the feature to make the movie longer, but this is the first time the short actually made the animated feature two hours. It was almost like I watched a double feature here.I'll try to stick to CoCo even though Frozen 1.5 as it should have been called was a spectacular picture on it's own.CoCo, was amazing. It may not come to a surprise to anyone that Pixar has up the game yet again.The story was fantastic. Darker than I would expect, but possibly because it of the content. It was about the Mexican culture's celebration of the day of the dead pretty much. It's very perfectly appropriate for children, however.No Disney Princess on this one, it was a Prince named Miguel in a perfectly design (Modern day) fairy tale (of an original story based on a Mexican tradition) about a boy who comes from a long line of shoe makers because his great great great grandmother forbid music within the family, as it took her husband away from her, but Miguel's passion for song causes him to curse himself which takes him to the land of the dead, where he has until sundown to find the family that would give him the blessing to go back to the world of the living without giving up music.Like every good Disney Prince(cess) Miguel's journey to the underworld is accompanied by Donte a stray hairless dog that's seems to resemble a spirit animal. It's a perfect Disney formula with a lot of cultural flavor to it that makes it special.The animation was fantastic. Especially, the backgrounds that were beautiful and rich with the heritage that inspired it. It made the animation feel like a moving painting and that's the best type of animation.Ironically, the one flaw in the film is that the music is not that memorable. Considering the story is about music. I should not complain as I'm not a fan of musicals, but I did notice that no songs playing got a hold of my soul. It does not hurt that Olaf's Frozen Adventure, which accompanies the film, is filled with musical numbers and is a semi-Sequel to a movie with a song that I herd little girls rock to on their headsets (Also want to point out that Disney (but not Pixar) had a cool catchy song in Moana, performed by Dwayne Johnson (but I'm biased cause I loved the Rock).Despite this, as if you need me to tell you how great a movie by Pixar is, let me tell you anyway. This is a winner!http://cinemagardens.com"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Simply the best and most emotional Pixar film I have ever seen. I didn't need the Frozen mini-movie at the beginning though but that was a studio choice, not a flaw of Coco.It may be animated but it definitely speaks to adults.Breathtaking artwork, insanely realistic textures and beautiful music. Perfect casting.I haven't shed this many tears watching a film since The Notebook."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Pixar, aside from a few weak entries with either Cars 2 or Brave, has always been the studio that places quality entertainment over making a quick buck. Coco is their latest outing, and I'd be absolutely lying to everyone if I didn't say that I loved every second of my viewing experience with this film. Coco is easily one of their best in years and possibly one of their best, period. Diving into themes that felt very risqu\u00e9 for this particular studio, I found that these particular elements only added to the overall story as a whole. Here is why I believe Coco is the must-see movie this year and why it will probably bring tears to many.Due to a tragic past that I won't discuss here, young Miguel (the main protagonist of the film) is forbidden to ever take up music as a profession. Looking up to the great Ernesto de la Cruz, he hopes to be like him one day (the greatest musician to ever live). As he borrows Ernesto's guitar to perform in a contest during the Mexican day of the dead celebration, he is sucked into the land of the dead, where he meets his ancestors. Discovering new things about life, death, and the importance of family, Coco is a film that will send you on a roller coaster ride of emotions.Throughout the first act of this movie, you feel as though it will be a touching story about a boy who's able to connect with the family he was never able to have met, but the hidden secrets will shock even the smartest of viewers. I hope you'll be as shocked with some of the reveals as I was because the writers have really outdone themselves in terms of making you care for these characters. Yes, the plot itself may have familiar elements, but what film doesn't nowadays?I believe that Coco found a way to spin the clich\u00e9s on their head, injecting some very dark aspects into this movie, which I found to be quite the risk but also worth it in the end. There are times when adults will feel as though they're watching a mature film due to how certain circumstances play out, and while kids can still enjoy the spectacle of this movie, this really is a children's movie for adults. That being said, the spectacle of it all is still worth the price of admission alone.Disney/Pixar continues to impress its audience in terms of how detailed the majority of their films have become, and Coco is no exception. Not only was I sucked up in the emotional journey that Miguel goes through, but the visuals only added a level of depth to the story, due to the fact that the animators have really made these people feel realistic, not in a true-to-life way, but in the way they move or speak to one another. This film is everything you could possibly ask for from Pixar.In the end, Coco is the reason we go to the cinema. We want to be transported to a unique world that makes us forget about reality, but that also reminds us how important reality still is. The core essence of this film's existence is to remind everyone that even the biggest of dreams will have their issues and that family really is the most important thing in life. Whether or not you choose to buy into that aspect will probably make or break your enjoyment of the movie, but I was moved to tears by it. Pixar has created another masterpiece in Coco and this may just be the best film I've seen all year. I can't recommend this beautiful piece of filmmaking enough."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Coco is spectacular. After many recent dips in quality, Pixar has delivered a picture that's quite the return to form and a respectful interpretation of Mexican culture. Coco is a dazzling and emotional Mexican fairy tale with plucky characters, smart twists, lively music, and tons of fast and creative animation to back it all up. Along with Inside Out, I personally think Coco reaches the heights of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up, and all the Pixar classics prior to the company's downfall starting with Cars 2, and I hope it's regarded as a classic for years to come. I can tell Pixar poured a lot of passion and inventiveness into this one and it really shows."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "It is hard to find a movie which manages to balance story, comedy, music, and connects you to their characters. Coco has truly been one of Pixar's greatest masterpieces. It has a great story and message and it will appeal to both adults and children. I got actual goosebumps in certain moments and it really made me appreciate how much a movie can shock and move you. This was a beautiful picture and I can't do anything but recommend others to watch it because you won't regret a second of it. Also, to those that have already watched the movie and those who haven't, please don't forget your loved ones, remember the moments you spend with them, they matter."}]
