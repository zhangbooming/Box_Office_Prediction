[{"score": "10/10", "review": "Denis Villeneuve, you magnificent world wonder, you did it again!I have seen this film three times in the cinema, in 3D, 2D and 4DX.And one of the things i have noticed with this film, is that it's not the time in the cinema that takes up my time, It's the hours upon hours in between spent thinking about the film, that is the real time consumer. This film left such a deep and profound impact, which i cannot escape. And I've gone back to the cinema twice to be \"tortured\", but it's worth it.It's a dark, mysterious, grim, hopeless, sad and lonely film, set in a possible near future where the human race is hanging by their fingertips on the edge of doom. So it's quite depressing. But it's so brilliantly put together, the closest master of cinema i think of that has done something similar, is Stanley Kubrick.Many Stanley Kubrick films were also \"hated\" by many when they first released. \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" for example, which had gorgeous visuals, but felt flat and hollow for many, even professional reviewers back then. But what Kubrick did best with his films, was to create afterthought. People left the cinema feeling confused and even depressed, but the movies planted a seed which then grew for years. The original Blade Runner also accomplished this. BR2049 is no exception, this movie will without doubt live on to be interpreted, analyzed and discussed for decades to come. The story continues from the original, but stands completely on it's own, it tells a new story that directly interlink with the original, but without trying to be a copy, it's a natural continuation in the same universe. You don't have to see the original Blade Runner first, though i do recommend it, see the final cut.BR2049 has some of the most gorgeous visuals i have ever seen, and the cinematography is out of this world, there is literally no excuse not to give Roger Deakins the Oscar this time. After 13 nominations he has now knocked the ball out of the park and is this year in his own league entirely. It's confusing to look at something so gorgeous, whilst painting a picture of such a sad and lost world. It sort of collides with your senses, your eyes say it's beautiful, your mind say it's depressing. Which senses are you going to believe? What does it mean? At least don't confuse feeling depressed as a sign that this movie is bad, it's nothing wrong feeling depressed, take it in, embrace it. Then you will know how it feels to be a replicant that's trapped in a caged mind.BR2049's story happens 30 years after the original, and there is three short films on Youtube i recommend you watch. These short films describes some of what happened in between 2019 and 2049. Watching them makes it slightly easier to understand some of the things going on. But the underlying theme is the same as it was in the original. What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to have memories? What is a soul? And so on.The world has gone darker in 2049, climate is spinning out of control, almost all animals and plants have died. People are desperate and lost, law enforcement can barely keep anything together, and only a small spark can set of total disaster, which is looming just around every corner. Niander Wallace has taken over Tyrell Corp and has by the time 2049 takes place designed millions of obedient replicants that does exactly what he tells them to do. But there is one thing Wallace has not been able to perfect, and that's what the main story is all about, and Wallace will do anything in his power to get his hands on the \"technology\", which will result in him becoming many hundred times richer and more powerful, the sole ruler of the entire universe. He is so far gone in his mind by 2049 he actually believes he is god himself, and he calls his replicants angels.And of course he also uses replicants to do his \"dirty work\". In 2049 we meet his right hand \"girl\" Luv (Brilliantly played by Sylvia Hoeks, if there is one actor in this movie that steal the show, it's her). Luv is a \"handygirl\" so to speak, that perform whatever task she is set to do, with no remorse. Or is that entirely true? I can't spoil anything, but look closely at Luv's character arc. All the other actors also do an outstanding job in this film, no bad performances, but i can't talk about all of them due to the word limit in these reviews.Be prepared going to see this film, it's depressing and heavy on your mind, and it demands your full attention. It's one of those rare films who dares to challenge the audience, and by doing so, taking a huge risk, and a 155 million dollar risk at that. The film isn't perfect, but it's close, and it shows the tremendous skills of Denis Villeneuve. And those few mistakes this movie have, are probably just happy little accidents as Rob Ross would have put it. This film is very much like a painting, every stroke of the brush matters, and every little detail is carefully crafted, it takes monumental skills to pull it of.I loved this film, it's the best film I've seen all year, It is a must see, a monumental triumph of a film that's just as good (possibly even better) as the original and one of the best sequels of all time!9.7/10 - MasterpieceAnd BTW Villeneuve's next movie might be Dune, imagine if he brings Deakins and the rest of this team to make that movie. Yeah, I'm going to leave you with that thought. This is basically porn."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "First let me just say that I am not going to spoil any of the plot points of this movie as the director has himself insisted not to and I urge the reviewers to come to respect his wish.Now let me just start by saying the original Blade Runner was one of the most influential sci-fi film to be ever made. Some people may not like it as it is very slow paced and deeply philosophical and I respect their opinion but you cannot deny its legacy. As it so happens Blade Runner 2049 might just fall on the same category. Directed by Denis Villeneuve who directed Incedies, Prisoners(another masterpiece), Arrival, Sicario and Enemy has outdone himself. This is seriously his best film to date. Even though this is a sequel to a movie he wasn't involved in whatsoever he has managed to expand its universe extremely elegantly and marked his directorial trademark in it. I won be surprised if he is put in the same bracket as Kubrick, Spielberg, Tarantino, Scorsese, Eastwood in the coming years. Talking about greatness we have director of photography propelled by Roger Deakins who already had his hands on Shawshawnk Redemption, No Country for Old Men, Skyfall, The Big Lebowski and Fargo to just name a few and to think he has never won an Oscar despite being nominated 13 times. Well this is about to change this year or you cannot ever take Academy seriously because I strongly believe this is his best work. The way he uses color palette is quite remarkable to watch and it might just be one of the best looking film to ever exist. Acting wise Harrison Ford gives one of his performance in a long time. You can just feel he loved working on this film(unlike that reboot on 2015). I have always been a fan of Ryan Gosling since Drive(another Neo-Noir masterpiece) and after watching this I am convinced that he is one of the best actor working today. Jared Leto gives a another stellar performance as expected from an Academy winner. Dave Bautista, Robin Wright, Ana de Armas all are impressive with their given role. Another thing that made the original Blade Runner so iconic was the soundtrack. And with this film it is no exception. Though this has Hans Zimmer Benjamin Wallfisch collaborating it feels a individual work like the first one. What else can I say? No praise is enough for what I just witnessed. This is one of those films that will inspire people to be filmmakers, that will make people realize why we go to cinemas and spent our hard earned cash, that will continue to put cinemas as art forms. Just go to the biggest theater possible and witness an piece of modern art put on by extremely visionary and talented people. You will not regret it. 10/10"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "The title says it all. Honestly, I don't think I need to develop any argument here, because all you need to do to realize this is true is to watch the film. So I say it again - the most amazing movie you will get to see in your whole life.I won't lie, I was really nervous about this film, then came the critics and all these reviews and I felt like it might actually be good - and you know what? It's not good, it's brilliant. It's what every filmmaker has tried to do, ever. This movie is for now what we can achieve best in filmmaking and storytelling. It is all any professional worked for..."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "My title is a bit provocative, but the Harrison Ford problem symbolizes the gist of what would be my complaint for Blade Runner 2049.Producers shouldn't be involved in script writing. During the first half of the movie, the script did seem to succeed in setting up the same kind of mood and depth than the original, using similar plot devices yet having its own personality. But being a sequel/reboot of a cult movie, (I suppose) producers insisted that the film included some of the original cast, and as many references to the original film as possible; nostalgia is money to them, after all... So they made it so that the movie stuffed as many as possible recognizable elements from the original: audio and footage, and of course, one of the most beloved star of the 80s, Harrison Ford.The problem is the movie could have been good enough without all this, and actually would have been better. There's nothing taking me out of a movie more than extract from the movie it comes from. And there's nothing making me forget how cool Deckard was than Harrison Ford being Harrison Ford, the funny angry old man he never stopped playing for more than 10 years now. Harrison Ford is quite a problem in this movie, I can't stress that enough. I couldn't see Deckard any second.Another character gratuitously reintroduced was Gaff, played by James Edward Olmos. James Edward Olmos, as brilliant as he is, seems stuck with William Adama's character from Battlestar Galactica. They would have named Gaff any other name, the scene would have been as effective and useless, since the character doesn't bring anything to the story, nor the movie, unfortunately. Those kind of obviously gratuitous nod to the fans are cringe worthy.Producers are way too condescending with the audience I fear, and/or way too fearful, and thereby, ruin what could have been a beautiful movie. In a way, it's worse than the failure of SW EP VIII, cause The Force Awakens didn't make any sense from start to finish, it was a mess, so there was nothing to regret, except the fact that it wasn't a good movie. But here, the cinematography is exceptional, sound design top notch, and the story of K was actually interesting, and could have bloomed into a very deep emotional and philosophical tale. But it's abruptly interrupted by the necessity of giving some importance to the fact that Harrison Ford was in the first movie and that, according to producers, fans would not tolerate a new Blade Runner without him.There's also this horrendous trend of recreating actors via CG. Please, for the love of movie making, stop! The scene in which they include this was gratuitous, stupid, because the CG isn't ready for that, it couldn't work on an emotional level. The results are too creepy for that.Another thing that fell a bit short was the music. Although it does a good job at evoking the original, it fails at creating any memorable theme unlike Vangelis work. It's really just an evocation. It does blend well in the pictures, and the overall sound design of the move, but I fear it also tends to leave some scenes a bit too dry.All in all, it's a disappointment, not so much as a sequel, but in itself. It may sound paradoxical, but as a sequel, it does a rather good job, in the sense, that on many levels, it retains many of the qualities of the original. But because of all those outstanding visual and sonic qualities, it disappoints even more when it suddenly and absurdly fails to deliver the emotional part of the deal it was building up with such talent from the beginning."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "After a 30 years gap, this continuation answers almost all the questions remaining at the end of the first episode (you'd better watch it before or read a good abstract in order to understand...), but it opens even deeper existential interrogations! Compared to 1982, it introduces some newer technologies (drones, holograms, augmented reality) and suggests some present themes (racism {against androids}, gender and clothing issues, human food {from insects}, bees dying, possible loss of digital memories {total blackout}). It uses some audio archives and a short sequence from the original footage, which allows a key character to make an incredible come back! But this VFX integration is rather elegant, at least in the 2D version. In short: Not a remake nor just a tribute, but an interesting follow-up!"}, {"score": "1/10", "review": "To make this 160+ min. monstrosity with nothing more than a paper thin story, with actors that can't even act being emotionally distant robots, with so-called futuristic booming sounds going off with every little pathetic emotion happening to the main character, the director literally blew every scene to a lengthy 5, 10 or 15 minutes annoyance fest. I had very few expectations when going to this film. But I had some. So I got utterly disappointed since even those low expectations weren't met! I'm genuinely amazed that this director has managed to make a dull, lifeless film from beginning to end. But then again he f*cked up 'Arrival' as well, so I shouldn't be surprised. Also congrats to the writer who managed to screw over his own legacy!"}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "To chase after an iconic masterpiece, to imitate or to try and supplant its rightful place, is a fool's errand.Thankfully director Denis Villeneuve along with his talented collaborators never succumbs to imitating or trying to super-cede Ridley Scott's 1982 landmark \"Blade Runner\". Hampton Fancher, who created the story of the original, has crafted a new screenplay with Michael Green, that not only builds on the themes of \"Blade Runner\", but ties them together with larger questions about the current human state and its challenges.Ryan Gosling stars as a replicant of the latest generation, who tries to solve a puzzle that leads him into the realm of real and manufactured life, and walks along the same noirish paths that made the original so gripping. Gosling imbues his character with a very compelling fa\u00e7ade, which starts to crumble as his humanity takes over his mechanical design.The equally thrilling performances by Jared Leto, Ana De Armas, Robin Wright, Carla Juri and of course Mr. Harrison Ford, forge a credible bond with the audience and enhance the visual grandeur created by cinematographer Roger Deakins and production designer Dennis Gassner.And although \"Blade Runner 2049\" may not achieve the same level of force as its predecessor, it is a tremendously immersive, philosophical and touching experience, that should be enjoyed on the largest screen possible. The movie's pace is deliberately patient, which may confuse some members of the audience. But by slowing down and observing, the audience can revel in the immensity of the images.The more we move, inexorably it seems, towards the do-or-die reality of \"Blade Runner\", the more vital these stories become.Whatever the box-office-fate of \"Blade Runner 2049\" will be, the long wait has paid off. It is far more than just a quick cash-in on a cult classic or an overly devoted sequel. It stands on its own and adds many new layers to the question: \"What makes us human?\" And it urges us on to find the truth in the rain."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Let me start by saying that I am a huge Denis Villeneuve fan and absolutely love every movie he made, from his breakthrough drama 'Incendies' to the action thriller 'Sicario'. But when I learned that he was going to make a sequel to Ridley Scott's iconic Blade Runner I had mixed feelings. Would he be able to live up to the expectations and make a sequel that could measure itself with the original? For this reason, I went into the cinema thinking ''This will be a great movie, I am a Villeneuve fan so I have to like it'' but that was a mistake, for once I stopped expecting and just started experiencing the film, I was enchanted by all of its visual beauty. I was wrong to doubt Villeneuve; his 'Blade Runner 2049' even succeeds in transcending in some ways the original masterpiece, especially as a visual experience. The bleak dystopian future Scott so perfectly created is even more beautiful in Villeneuve's 2049, for which a lot of credit has to be given to the brilliant director of photography Roger Deakins, who has made one of his best works (which says a lot). Every shot is brilliant, I loved every single frame and I cannot imagine that he wouldn't get nominated and win an Oscar for this phenomenal work. But also a big thumbs up has to be given to the entire effects team, for Deakins didn't do it all on his own. Deakins isn't the only mastermind at work, for the score is also beautifully done. When I learned that composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson (someone who has collaborated multiple times with Villeneuve and did most of the scores for his movies) got fired I was surprised; J\u00f3hannsson has always delivered great work, but according to Villeneuve, his score ''wasn't the right one'' for this movie for it didn't ''resemble Vangelis soundtrack for Blade Runner'' quite enough. So he got replaced by probably the best man in the business nowadays; Hans Zimmer. And as we are used to with the German composer, this was once again sublime and a great homage to the original. Zimmer's 2049 score can be compared to his Dunkirk score, in a way that it unsettles us from the first chord and just as the Second World War movie, it keeps us on the edges of ours seats, especially during the last hour.As for the people who are actually situated in front of the camera, they all play their parts very well. I was especially happy that Ryan Gosling's agent K was indeed the leading man and he did a very good job. I was slightly concerned that it would mostly be about Harrison Ford's Deckard, but luckily that wasn't the case. Nevertheless, Ford gives one of his best performances in years and after all the iconic roles he played once again in recent years (Han Solo, Indiana Jones) this is by far the best. The smaller but important roles are also noteworthy; Robin Wright's Lieutenant Joshi makes a fierce and convincing police chief, while the villain duo Jared Leto's Neander Wallace as the evil head of a corporation at the top of the new world order and his frightening hit-woman Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) are also very impressive. Last but not least, Ana de Armas is also very good as Joi, K's girlfriend (even if she does remind me a lot of Scarlet Johansson in 'Her' and slightly of Alicia Vikander in 'Ex Machina', but maybe that's something Villeneuve did that on purpose and wanted to pay homage to these recent but also very good science-fiction movies).That said, Villeneuve will receive most of the credit, as he should. For unlike most of Hollywood's blockbusters nowadays, he doesn't simply deliver us a spectacle with some nice effects or a reboot of the original, but he picks up the threads where Scott left, which was a monumental task, for the original 'Blade Runner' is one of the most impressive and iconic movies ever made. 2049 continues on the same topics raised by the original, making the sequel worth the 35-year long wait; it goes further with what was proposed in the first installment, enriching one another. It is possible that one day a third installment could be made, but that is only if any director will ever find the courage to make another 'Blade Runner', for the bar is raised incredibly high. I believe that in time, 'Blade Runner 2049' will just as the original one, grow into a cult movie, and rightfully so, for it is its own movie, but, just as the original, a visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece. I am not going to say more about it, because the studio has been unusually insistent in its pleas to critics and the first movie viewers not to reveal any plot points, but I am glad they did. Even if I could go on and on about the movie and the difference between replicants and humans (or is there really much of a difference, after all?) the less you know the better, because 2049 feels at its best when it surprises (which is one of Villeneuve's greatest strengths). This is a movie best experienced on the biggest screen in your cinema; trust me, it will be worth your while. As for me, I will most likely try and make some free time in my schedule for the coming days, 'cause I want to go the cinema again, guess what I'm gonna watch..."}, {"score": "4/10", "review": "As a fan of Villeneuve, Deakins and most of the cast I was looking forward to this. Villeneuve repeats his style of slow-pan drawn-out tension, as he's accompanied by the majestic touches of Roger Deakins in completing the feel of each shot.We are drawn into the flawlessly created Blade Runner world, where we seek a story that will keep us on the edge of our seat, longing for more. Unfortunately, that just wasn't fulfilled. Any anticipation was lost in the pace.I cannot fault the world that was created, nor can I fault the plot which was solid enough. It's the pace of the film that loses some of the audience. In the cinema I was in the tension gave way to boredom for many viewers. A couple of people walked out about mid-way, whilst there was a restlessness about many who remained.For those who are determined to see this, strap in for a long, long ride. Try your very best to immerse yourself and enjoy the visual feast but don't expect the film to deliver on the hype of the trailer. It's a slow burn that isn't for everyone."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "To be honest with the reader of this review, I had never seen the first Blade Runner however it had been near the top of my \"must- watch\" science fiction movie list in my head for a very long while now and I decided to watch this movie expecting an exciting sci-fi blockbuster with action-packed car chases rolling in all over the place. Surprisingly this film was not the \"good action-packed popcorn fun for the whole family\" that I was expecting and the film actually takes the slower, more patient and realistic approach with it's storytelling rather than a lot of car chases and rushed editing. This is a very similar film to the likes of A Fistful Of Dollars because the main character, Ryan Gosling, resembles the personality of Clint Eastwood's character in A Fistful Of Dollars, the musical score carries away the movie like A Fistful Of Dollars, the pacing remains slow however manages successfully to keep our interest like A Fistful Of Dollars and the film carries an incredibly dark, bleak tone much like A Fistful Of Dollars. I'm glad I saw this movie earlier than most people because then I can write a good review for this movie so that more people can consider watching it before the negative remarks start coming in. Before those come in, let me remind you that this movie is pure, bleak, raw and dark science-fiction to the core that goes with the dedication to telling a story rather than the dedication to kill as much people as possible. It goes with the more slow approach which some people may find a bad thing but others like me will find a good thing. But I think something all viewers will respect here in this movie is the intense cinematography that is common in a lot of other Denis Villeneuve movies and the fascinating special effects as well as the subtle performances by Ryan Gosling who understands the character he is playing and doesn't overdo it. Ryan Gosling's character is an interesting one because although he is emotionless and straight- forward we, as the viewers, can detect that there is more to this character and throughout the movie we slowly start to see a bit more of his own self. Blade Runner 2049 focuses mostly on the main character and if you are going to see this movie expecting Harrison Ford to have a lot of screen time that is similar to the length of Ryan Gosling's screen time, you're very wrong because Harrison Ford only plays a minor role in this movie which is, although important, not the main focus of the movie. Even if someone can view this movie as a science-fiction movie, someone can also view this movie as a character piece instead depending on their preference because of how much dedicated focus is on the main character.When the movie was finished and all was done, despite the reasonably long runtime I still felt that the movie should of been even longer. Because I don't like to be sentimental I gave myself thirty seconds and then I got up from my chair and walked out as the credits rolled despite me still being in a very deep emotional zone however I want you to know that the emotional zone was almost impossible to get out of. As I was walking out I still saw a person watching the credits in his chair and I understood that he was also in a very deep emotional state and people usually do that so that they look cool to their friends, but the person I saw really was in an emotional zone - I could tell. I could also tell that I wasn't the only one that enjoyed this movie in the room and I was relieved because I was a bit afraid that people wouldn't like it because of it's more slower approach than other science-fiction movies. I was incredibly glad that someone else understood the style of the movie.I'm not going to spoil any more of the movie but I will leave a last note to say that Blade Runner 2049 is an incredibly dark and intense movie that is probably one of the best science-fiction movies I've seen that has been made in the last five years so it very much is a masterpiece. If a futuristic version of A Fistful Of Dollars sounds bloody good to you, then you'd be killing yourself if you didn't pay this movie a visit at your nearest cinema. In my personal opinion, the film was most definitely a masterpiece and it has me even more excited for seeing the original starring Harrison Ford in the main role."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "I was lucky enough to see this first day playing in Belgium so I could avoid any spoiler I might read online. So I won't say anything about the story or the plot, just know it's good. A lot better than I expected really. You have to know I absolutely adore the first Blade Runner and know the movie in and out. So scepticism came kinda natural to me.But boy was I wrong. Not only did Villeneuve manage to make this a sequel which can easily stand next to the original, but he avoided the trap of making this movie a fan-service and to put as much reference to the original into his movie to please the hardcore Blade Runner crows. No, he made this movie his own, while expanding the universe created by Ridley without simply copying it. It just works...like the iPhone 33 will in 2049 ;)The visuals are striking, the soundtrack pays great homage to the original while having a more bombastic and frankly dark tone to it, the acting it superb, the way they introduce Deckard is simply fantastic and the way the story unfolds just adss to the whole mythology of Blade Runner.I'm so very pleased to have viewed this movie without spoiling anything for myself concerning either the visuals and story and urge you to do the same.

Ridley Scott's original film was released in 1982 and based in 2019. The highly anticipated sequel from Denis Villenueve is being released in 2017 and based in 2049. So we have 35 years between films, and 30 years between story settings. Expect that to be the most complicated part of this review since we were mandated by the studio to follow many rules \u2013 write this, don't write that. Such rules would normally be frowned upon (and even ignored by many), but in fact, this film does such a masterful job of paying homage to the first, while enhancing the characters and story, that we are eager for every viewer to experience it with fresh eyes and clear mind ... no matter how tempting it is to talk about!Obviously, the massive fan base that has grown over the years (the original was not an initial box office hit) will be filling the theatres the first weekend \u2013 even those who are ambivalent towards, or adamantly against, the idea of a sequel. The big question was whether screenwriters Hampton Fancher (maybe every writer should begin as a flamenco dancer) and Michael Green would be able to create a script that would attract new viewers while honoring the original film and source Philip K Dick novel, \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" The answer is not only a resounding yes, but it's likely even those who usually shy away from science-fiction may find themselves thoroughly enjoying the nearly 2 hours and 43 minute run time (it doesn't seem too long).The cast is deep and perfectly matched, and there are even a few surprises (no spoilers here). Ryan Gosling is fun to watch as the reserved K, an expert Blade Runner who tracks and \"retires\" old model replicants \u2013 the Nexus 8's have been replaced by the more- controllable Nexus 9's. An early sequence has K in combat mode against a protein farmer named Morton (played by the massive Dave Bautista). With all that is going on in these few scenes, director Villenueve is training us to lock in and pay attention, lest we miss the key to the rest of the movie and K's motivation for most everything he does from this point on. Robin Wright plays K's icy Lieutenant Joshi, who administers \"baseline\" tests to him after every successful mission \u2013 just to make certain he is still under her control.Jared Leto delivers an understated and mesmerizing performance as the God-like Wallace who not only managed to solve global hunger, but also is a genetic engineer creating new beings. Somehow, this is one of Leto's most normal roles (which makes quite a statement about his career) and yet his character is so intriguing, it could warrant a spin-off standalone film. Wallace's trusted assistant is the ruthless bulldog mis-named Luv, played by Sylvia Hoeks. Her scene with Robin Wright is one of the best on screen female duels we've seen in awhile. One of the more unusual characters (and that's saying a lot) is Joi (Ana de Armas), the Artificial Intelligence/hologram companion to K, whose presence is cued by Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf notes. Other support work to notice comes in brief but crucial roles by Hiam Abbas, Mackenzie Davis, Carla Juri, Barkhad Abdi and Lennie James. Who is not listed above? Of course it's Harrison Ford (as seen in the trailer), who reprises his Deckard role from the original. All these years later, he's a grizzled recluse who doesn't take kindly to home visitations. Mr. Ford offers up proof that he still possesses the acting ability that made him a movie star (even if his best piloting days have passed him by). It's such a thrill to see him flash the screen presence that's been missing for many years. And yes, fans of the first film will mourn the absence of the great Rutger Hauer, yet there is no need to dwell on one of the few negatives.The story leans heavily on philosophical and metaphysical questions \u0085 just like every great sci-fi film. What makes us human, or better yet, is there a difference between humans and machines that can think and feel? Can memories be trusted, or can they be implanted or influenced over time? These are some of the post-movie discussion points, which are surely to also include the cutting edge cinematography and use of lighting from the always-great Roger Deakins, and the production design from Dennis Gassner that somehow fits the tone, mood and texture of both the first film and this sequel. The set pieces are stunning and sometimes indistinguishable from the visual effects \u2013 a rarity these days. My theatre did feature the \"shaky seats\" that work in conjunction with the sound design \u0085 a gimmick I found distracting and more in line with what kids might find appealing.There was some unwelcome drama a couple of months ago as noted composer Johann Johannsson dropped out and was replaced with Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch. The resulting score complements the film without mimicking the original. Ridley Scott, who directed the original BLADE RUNNER (and its numerous versions over the years), was involved as Executive Producer, and to put things in perspective, the first film was released the same year as TOOTSIE and TRON. Denis Villenueve was Oscar nominated for directing ARRIVAL, and he has proved himself to be a superb and dependable filmmaker with SICARIO, PRISONERS, and INCENDIES. He deserves recognition and respect for his nods to the original (Pan Am, Atari) and ability to mold a sequel that stands on its own \u0085 and in my opinion, is better than the first. Hopefully stating that is not against the Warner Bros rules."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Visually stunning and perfectly balanced with sounds effects and music.

It is developing a story for 2h30 minutes and then suddenly in less than 15 minutes things happens in a hurry. I have the impression that the blue-ray version will be longer so the transition between some scenes will be more coherent. It should have been 20 minutes shorter OR 20 minutes longer to be more consistent. I can not give more detail to not spoil the plot.I liked it but I can not give 9/10.

One day while on a job, K discovers a long buried secret in the yard of a replicant which leads him on a journey to track down former Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who has been missing for decades.Featuring amazing visuals and some of the most philosophical and thought-provoking themes since the original, Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece of science fiction and is possibly one of the greatest sequels ever made. I was transfixed the entire time, to the point where I felt that even blinking would cause me to miss something I wanted to see. The cast was brilliant as well, especially Ryan Gosling, who does a fantastic job carrying the film as its lead actor. However, perhaps best of all, is that seeing the original is not a requirement to fully understand everything that is going on, although it would probably still help to have done so beforehand. I'm almost certain that author Philip K. Dick would be proud of this film. I know I am.I rate it a very high 9.5/10"}, {"score": "4/10", "review": "This is almost a 3 hour movie, but it honestly felt like at least 4 hours watching it. The pace starts off okay, but then seems to lag as minor plot lines take far too long to work through. The original had atmosphere and character; in this one they work very hard to create similar magic, but fail."}, {"score": "3/10", "review": "The original Bladerunner was a sci-fi noir classic, it had a mysterious and magical aura about it. Everything from the plot, sets, the classic Vangelis score and the meticulous level of detail was just sublime. This *cough* sequel *cough* is not even in the same ball park stylistically, story wise or in any other way. It felt cold and lacked the originals ambiance and magical tone,moved like molasses and the overly convoluted and sleep inducing story made me stare at the walls and other patrons to see if they were still awake. Hollywood has lost the plot literally and figuratively and it just goes to show that bigger budgets and fancier CGI do not make a superior film.They just don't make em' like they used to."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "I loved the original film, it left me wondering what just happened and where did the story go after the credits rolled, and that was fine for me. The Sequel just never takes off, it spends a lot of time selling the idea of the previous film, before it tries to come up with something new. There are many, many scenes in this film that are pointless and drawn out. They attempt to create an underlying theme but all they do is extend out parts of the film needlessly. Jared Leto's performance, in particular, is over acted and drawn out. His entire story line could be left out and the movie would function exactly the same, and would actually be more enjoyable. One of the scenes later in the film really ruins the legacy of the original. It was a homage that was as awful as the Leia scene in Rouge One.The main story is mildly interesting to a point, but it gets watered down with all the auxiliary re-hashed ideas from the previous film. Where as the original was a believable piece of Sci-Fi, this has scene after scene that leaves you sitting there thinking, \"So that just happened how exactly?\" Not worth the trip to the cinemas, glad my ticket was free."}, {"score": "1/10", "review": "Ugly cinematography, bad directing, all the actors look like they suffered from mania. Action is garbage, no where near the level of the masterpiece Kingsman: The Golden Circle. There is no cowboys or rednecks, it gets an instant 0. Harrison Ford cannot act or do action. He is too old, every time he tries to punch is a punch line. Ryan Gosling is boring and can't act. He should go back to Gay Gay Land. Ana de Armas is ugly and has no talent and she should just quit Hollyweird. This is the worst movie ever made.-100/10"}, {"score": "4/10", "review": "Like director Denis Villeneuve's other recent films, this is a simple and empty movie. It's pretentious and disguised as something clever and artistic. It's extremely slow and although I went to see it in the earliest show (in the morning) on the premiere day, I still had to keep myself from falling asleep. The audience was silent but when the end credits rolled I could hear the disappointment of others too.It's extremely long (163 min) and painfully slow and nothing much happens in it. Every scene and every shot is stretched endlessly, like watching an entire movie in slow motion. Ryan Gosling, a very talented actor, unfortunately once again plays the same character which seems to have sticked to him since DRIVER - extremely slow moving, minimum dialog, lots of staring (yeah, Red Letter Media were right in their satire of the trailer). There are bits of interesting scenes sprinkled throughout the movie but they just seem random and don't create any coherent story. It's like scenes and shots made to be put in a trailer.On the good side, there is a good production, good sets, impressive cinematography by veteran Roger Deakins, and they really tried to replicate (no pun intended) the world create in the original movie. If you watch closely, you'll even notice an ad for Pan Am, just like in the original movie. The music is also similar to Vangelis' style at times (including \"Tears in Rain\" at the end). I should mention that this is the second time this year that Hans Zimmer uses the Shepard tone and as much as I like Zimmer, the use of the Shepard tone here was too obvious.I was also very impressed by Carla Juri's scene as Dr. Ana Stelline and I liked the Joi/Mariette scene.All in all, this is a very disappointing movie with some good visuals. I kept my expectations low and I was still disappointed.4-4.5/10 Disappointing. For fans of director Denis Villeneuve."}, {"score": "1/10", "review": "I could write a mile long review about this movie, but I will give it as much effort as they put into this movie. Unfortunately that results in not much to say...Visually stunningly beautiful, but 3 hours of boring beyond belief textbook Hollywood sequel story."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "I went out as soon as I could to watch it. From trailer it seemed to be very interesting and very beautiful, I also watched the original a week before once again. I truly love the original and I enjoyed the soundtrack for the whole week before, nothing is as close to the eerie original blade runner soundtrack. So I went in on the 3D version.I won't spoil a lot. The movie is beautifully shot, although I'll see in 2D as well, because I prefer 2D brightness compared to 3D. The storyline can stand alone in 2049, although that is something I thought at the beginning. The more film goes deeper into the story the more I felt connected to the original film and I think the goers who have not seen the original or did not loved it for the all the weird reasons, will miss out on atmosphere and emotions conveyed in 2049. I enjoyed the duration, I enjoyed the acting, DP (well everyone is right about it). I had a little trouble to navigate into the 2049 storyline though, but I think it was on purpose, because by the end of the movie I still had (like in original blade runner) this monstrous question over (although different this time), I had a different feeling, I had confusion and I had developed love for the character - I think this would not be possible be it more concrete story, so by the end it helped to give the viewer exactly what he went in for (at least for me).Compared to the original, 2049 is more complex film, has a more complex storyline, but is worth every second of watching it. It is worth 30 years of wait. It is worth everything, for those who loved the original this is a beautiful continuation. It left me crying and as well thinking and as well it still leaves lot of questions. This is truly a beautiful film and Villeneuve has done amazing job on any aspect. Music, tension, visuals, acting and everything in 2049 feels complete, some scenes are simply fantastic both in action, physics involved and of course visually. I'm still in awe from this one, still thinking about it, and still having the emotion that I left the cinema with - and this is definitely something we pay money for. It sucks because I think general audience will not be moved by this dark sci-fi, but it is so beautiful and poetic, 2049 is obviously destined to be another cult. I also assume that haters will be saying how complicated this one is compared to the original but I have to say the complexity just made it more beautiful and let's be realistic making a sequel on the original could not be a streamlined story. Go watch 3 shorts as well on youtube to have some questions filled. If I had only one regret and complain about this film it would be that soundtrack album for this is not as beautiful as the original, but I guess that is what Hans Zimmer means, bringing in Vangelis was a very different thing for the original and bringing generic score composer on this one is well not enough creative I guess (nothing against Zimmer, but I was waiting for something more vulnerable as OST), and I would as well say that dialogues are not as powerful as in original, I wanted \"tears in rain\" moment here too, but I guess that is the result of a more complex storyline, we do not get that obvious phrases, but we get such a dense emotions through interior dialogues of characters and the atmosphere that it is enough. Overall words and review from my perspective is just a ramble, go and watch it and love it and feel it and bleed it - this is such a powerful cinematic piece!"}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "There is a lot to like about the film but the film is slow. Visually the film is a treat and Roger Deakins will probably get an Oscar for his cinematography. The score is OK but it doesn't feel as iconic as the original. The acting is good and Denis Villeneuve directing is excellent as usual. If you didn't have a problem with the pacing of the original, then you probably won't with this, though personally I do think the original is very slow and this film doesn't feel any different. The story is interesting but I won't say anything about it cause I don't want to spoil it for anyone. This film isn't an action film, more an art house film with action in it. Seeing the original isn't essential but probably worth doing and I would definitely say watch the 3 short films 2022, 2036, 2048.For me this isn't the perfect film I was hoping for and think that trimming half an hour away from the film would help. At times it does leave certain motivations unanswered and occasionally occasionally I feel the film tries to hard visually.At times Bladerunner 2049 is very impressive but I would probably prefer to re-watch it on Blu-ray than in the cinema, where I can stop and come back to it another time (very similar to the original)"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Yes, a masterpiece of canon, and style, and production. Spare and sensual, with an extraordinary central performance by Ryan Gosling, great plotting and dialogue in an examination of the nature of love, of memory and of identity. The best of science fiction in that it explores who we really are under almost inconceivable stresses.You can feel the love and effort poured into this movie in every second of film. The music evokes and expands on the original, returns us to this future we know so well from so long ago now.Remember: Science fiction has no ceiling.10 stars."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "BLADE RUNNER 2049's qualities are the acting, direction, unremittingly bleak photography, great computer-generated effects, and female beauty to die for.The film's main weakness is the plot, which rambles on and on and on. Yes, androids want to be more than electric sheep, that was obvious to Philip K. Dick when he wrote the novel that became the BLADE RUNNER of 1982. But Gosling's character's odyssey to track down Deckard (Harrison Ford), supposing that he is his father, is just too far- fetched to make any real sense, even if one appreciates that the android desperately wishes to feel human emotions. The memorable sequences are Gosling's lovemaking with a melding of two women, and Sean Young's brief return to the screen in all her beauty. The disappointing sequence is the climax underwater: In such a polluted world, you'd expect that water to kill you if you came into contact with it. Surviving all that time while fighting killing machines is just too improbable.Robin Wright's talent is sadly underused and the presence of a dog is truly mystifying - unless it, too, is an electric sheep.By the end of it, there was a bittersweet reunion between Deckard and his daughter, making for a relatively \"happy\", if rather pointless, ending. Sadly, by then my life was 163' shorter with very little to show for it. Disappointing 6/10."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Denis Villeneuve's new film Blade Runner 2049 is nothing short of ... just downright amazing. Everything about this movie is practically perfectly executed from the gripping and fluid performances to the color infused cinematography to the powerful soundtrack and sound design the film practically never skips a beat. The only flaw that wasn't really even a flaw in my opinion was that some scenes dragged for quite a while but I believe that the slow camera work was intended. The film has everything that made the philosophical original (final cut) a flawed masterpiece just it has everything the original was lacking.Gostling fit perfectly for the role of 'K', being emotionless but so full of emotion. Sylvia Hoeks was someone very worthy of a mention, giving an effectively eerie performance. Jared Leto as always is intensively remarkable and glued my eyes to the screen in each and every scene. Harrison gave one of the best and most emotional performances I have seen in his career.Now Hans Zimmer again blew me away completely. I got chills every 30 seconds when the cinematography and the score perfectly intertwined into an extraordinary absorbing symphony that makes the world of Blade Runner so real despite how unimaginable it actually is.10/10"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "This review of Blade Runner 2049 is spoiler free ***** (5/5) WHEN RIDLEY SCOTT released the first Blade Runner back in 1982 it was unlike anything before it, it was essentially more than just a film with an impressively compelling performance from Harrison Ford, it was immediately noticed as a technological accomplishment filled to the brim with an impressive collection of special effects \u2013 the moving holographic billboards were enough to make your eyes pop, the flying cars which now are more of a fantasy than a reality and a combination humans and robots called replicants. It really achieved higher than any other sci-fi before and even after the time \u2013 which essentially is why today it goes down as a masterpiece and perhaps the best that cinema has ever been. However when French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve announced that he was going to do a sequel long time fans were sceptical about it saying that it wouldn't be as good, it would give the predecessor a bad name and won't go down as well.Emphatically now at the long-awaited release of Blade Runner 2049 you can erase your fears as this is by far the best a sci-fi sequel has ever been. We open with Ryan Gosling's Officer KD6-3.7 a Blade Runner for the Los Angeles Police Department who's on a case to bring in any old replicants while on the case he unearths a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what's left of society into chaos which could destroy everything they have come to know. Set in a world where the Earth is left in anarchy after an event which shook the world and brought the people of the city into fear shattering previous memories everything is left empty seemingly without repair. The film erupts from the opening reel as Villeneuve drags you into the often lonely life of Gosling's policeman who tries everything to repair his life back to the way it was, his character is complex yet cleverly thought out thanks to a script penned by Hampton Fancher and co-writer Michael Green they give his character a simple story but he's emotional too dealing with feelings way beyond his thoughts. And for any of you La La Landers out there Gosling is on top of his game much like Ford's performance in the film's predecessor he's incredible and brings a powerful dynamic to his story and essentially the film would be nothing without him.As an experience it's a must see especially in IMAX \u2013 it's loud ominous score quakes around the halls shattering your eardrums from the vibrations, the beautiful giant holographic billboards are enough to make your eyes pop just looking at the colour and the bright city lights and the sci-fi action is riveting and fast paced. Immediately after entering the live futuristic city of Los Angeles it's clear that Villeneuve is right at home here using the same directing techniques he's become accustomed with during Sicario, Prisoners or indeed Arrival using impressive close-ups, stunning long shots and eye-shattering panoramic shots. However at a runtime of 2 hours 43 minutes it's quite a long marathon that you will have to exercise for before stepping into the theatre yet that exercise is worth and is thoroughly paid off.Stylistically it is a Blade Runner film so for long-time fans the environment will be all too familiar and producer Scott who's happy to be back in this territory he makes every collection of images as real as possible bringing Villeneuve's imagination to life it really doesn't get any better than this. Happily when Ford's Rick Deckard comes onto the audience smiles from ear-to-ear. Story wise his character is a bit like Luke Skywalker from Star Wars: The Force Awakens he has been missing for thirty years and there is an extensive search for him. When found, Rick doesn't take to K at first he immediately thinks that K is trying to kill him. Here Ford now 75 years old looks a little worse for wear as if he's been lost aching for a little company which has been missing from his life and he brings this emotion into his character's grief giving him some emotional prowess which thanks to his stunning performance pays off.Happier still, the action is incredible there are only a few action scenes but each one is as brutal as the previous time round \u2013 Villeneuve introduces the action scenes as a cinematic thespian adding momentum to the white knuckle punches and a deafening ping from the two characters' blasters which surprisingly look as good as new. The action is relentless, fast-paced and utterly riveting from a wide-eyed opening fight scene with Dave Bautista's Sapper Morton, through electric chase scenes to a brutal final fight scene they are compelling and Villeneuve lets them play their toll painting a shiny gloss to the end credits. What Villeneuve has created in Blade Runner 2049 is an impressive, compelling and brilliant sci-fi sequel that shines with a glossy finish and will still look good with multiple viewings and is an experience that will last for decades to come.VERDICT: An impressive exercise of stunning colour, immersive CG images and incredible techniques Villeneuve's sequel isn't just a movie, it's a technological accomplishment, and is by far this year's best film."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Arrival was my favourite movie last year, now this: Dennis Villeneuve became one of the best active directors in my opinion (with Danny Boyle, PT Anderson, Christopher Nolan).The casting on this movie is just perfect, especially when it comes to the women, such strong characters.

My biggest take away is the score by Hans Zimmer. Not only did it honor the original music with a tribute to Rutger Hauer's final scene in BR, it presented outrageous volumes of synthesized leads and strings swelling from side to side in genuine majesty to the visuals most of the way through the film. I was mesmerized and in awe of the powerful support this gave to the plot. The audio montages and foley FX were right up there in quality leaving me in no doubt that I now have to admit that the original BR has been displaced as my all time Number 1 movie by this stunning, elegant production. It is simply breathtaking in its presentation and well worth SciFi history."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "As a big fan of the original I had a few doubts about the sequel when I read that some critics had been reviewing the follow-up as \"better than the original\".

The visual effects are nothing short of incredible, and definitely add to the entire experience. Acting is great from both Gosling and Harrison Ford.

Many fans of the first film expected to see something similar, but Denis Villeneuve introduced us his view of the universe, while retaining the spirit of the first film.Story. The creators of the film made every effort to keep the story in secret, and this was not done in vain. In order not to reveal the essence of the story, I just want to say that this is a story about how one way or another, everyone considers himself to be special. Director. Denis Villeneuve also brought us a lot of things that humanity is realizing in the near future. In most of his films Villeneuve touches on the theme of children, in this film he also devoted much time to the theme of parents and children. In fact, as some critics noted, the picture is very similar to Tarkovsky's work, the meditative narrative of the film allows us to reflect on philosophical questions: are all our memories real and is man really a supreme being?Music and visual effects. Despite the fact that there were two outstanding composers working on the film (Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer), the music in the film is quite small and it is not remembered. Basically, all the compositions are very similar to each other and create an exceptionally tense atmosphere. A small amount of original music in the film partially compensates for the appearance in the film songs by Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. Unlike music, the film strikes a visual component. The film implements completely new creative design ideas, thanks to which you experience a real visual pleasure.The Result. In the end, we can say that Villeneuve did not turn \"Blade Runner 2049\" into another remake movies, the main task of which is to tell the same story with modern shooting technologies to attract a new audience and sell toys. After watching the film i have a strong desire to see it again on the big screen.9 out of 10"}]
