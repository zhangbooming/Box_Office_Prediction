[{"score": "10/10", "review": "\"The Post\" arrives to remind us about the indispensable role of the press in a democracy, ours in this particular case. An historical fact that comes to illustrate the dangerous times we're living now. The story of The Pentagon Papers is not ancient history and yet people seem to have forgotten. Americans in their 20's don't know about it as they didn't know about the House Of UnAmerican Activities. Education is at the center of our future so thank you Steven Spielberg for contributing to the awakening. In \"The Post\" the economy of the retelling is part of its brilliance. Tom Hanks as Ben Bradlee is not Jason Robards but a Hanks, profoundly human, version of the man and Meryl Streep - Oh Meryl Streep ! - gives life to a woman who was not used to be the center of attention. A daughter a wife never in charge. Her dilemma is the sort of dilemma that, artists, teachers, parents, often confront. Her process to arrive to her decision is immensely moving and real. One of the miracles that Meryl Streep manages to perform again and again is that one forgets that it is her a second after she appears on the screen. I know this is a film I see again and show to youngsters at every possible opportunity. Thank you for that."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "After finishing the movie the first thought came to my mind is that it is another masterpiece from spielberg and his co. I have seen almost all the movies of spielberg and all those are always included in my favourite list. So i was eagerly waiting for another spielberg film as i know his ability and creativity . But this movie is far beyond the spielberg factor. Because the plot is a true event that discloses the original power and responsibility of press and mass media over our political and state life. It is a conflict that reminded us the true colour of anarchy and democracy, it's central effects in all sphere of life. It is a true inspiration of win of truth over power and bureaucracy. And who but Spielberg could have given this true motivational conflict into a proper dramatic figure along with Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep. Many will find this movie as a slow and old pattern movie but you have to keep in mind that these movies are to be opened slowly and steadily . The movie has gathered perfect pace with every minute and has created enough interest for audiences to keep them on their toes. This is a very furnished spielberg movie ......like many other classics he has delivered....this one is a classic."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Spielberg's new drama about the controversial publication of the Pentagon Papers by the Washington Post and New York Times is a well-made and entertaining, albeit not perfect, film. Tom Hanks gives a thorough and enjoyable performance as Ben Bradlee, but it is Meryl Streep who truly stands out in the cast here through her role as Kay Graham. Bob Odenkirk's supporting role is also noteworthy in a very positive sense.The film is thoroughly gripping, although it sometimes feels paced slightly clumsily through omissions of details that could have been better to include as Spielberg presents the audience with the turbulent politics of the Vietnam era that lead to the intense legal and ideological controversies surrounding the Pentagon Papers. Additionally, a rushed--albeit still very enjoyable--third act makes the viewer feel that the film's running time is a bit too short. The film is an enjoyable watch in a way that other journalism films like \"All The President's Men\" and \"Spotlight\"--while better films overall for sure--are not, but its tone is handled well throughout. If Spielberg's dramas have taught me one thing, it's that he clearly knows how to let a specific tone manifest itself throughout the course of a narrative and do that well. The film contains a few moments that feel a bit 'meh' (a very clich\u00e9d rather than powerful discussion of the importance of freedom of the press in the second half is one.) While it has neither the high emotional stakes and dramatic tension of \"Bridge of Spies\" or the clockwork precision of \"Lincoln,\" it is still a very well-acted and entertaining film that I do recommend. 7/10"}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Steven Spielberg returns to top-form with 'The Post'. This courageous & rousing true-story on the quest of The Washington Post & co., who used the power of Freedom Of Speech & went against the government and exposed a shocking truth, remains as timely as it was during the administration of Richard Nixon and now with Donald Trump. Its a timely film, that never forgets to entertain, despite its strong theme of democracy. 'The Post' depicts journalists from The Washington Post and The New York Times who published the Pentagon Papers regarding the involvement of the United States government during the Vietnam War.Spielberg has made a chase film with journalists. We watch the Team of The Washington Post go at it & their journey to uncover & publish the truth, will you you engrossed & captivated. With an outstanding ensemble cast who bring in their A-Game here, Spielberg edges out a historical political-thriller, with huge success. This is a relentless, courageous film, that has its pulse rising each moment & watching its HEROES uncover the truth & going against the government with force. 'The Post' is truly about informing the people about the truth & how the ones we lose at the war ground, are at times sacrificed in the name of cover-ups and heartless politics. Its truly a film punches you hard! Liz Hannah & Josh Singer's Screenplay is first-rate. Its gripping & sharp, never giving you chance to look away from the screen or the truth. Spielberg's Direction is terrific. The Legendary Oscar-Winning Director is in peak form, delivering one of his finest films in years. He commands the film with an urgency, that is much required here. He deserves some Oscar buzz for sure. Janusz Kaminski's Cinematography is fantastic. The lensman has captured the urgency of the narrative, to perfection. Michael Kahn & Sarah Broshar's Editing is razor-crisp. Art & Costume Design are top-notch. John Williams' Score is good, as always.Now coming to the performances! Meryl Streep as Kay Graham & \nTom Hanks as Ben Bradlee, are in superb from. Streep is wonderfully restrained in her portrayal of a woman facing chauvinism, despite being in power. The legend sinks her teeth into the part & brings it out with flying colors. Hanks is flat-out-fabulous, enacting the part of a man in search of exposing the truth. Hanks is heroic all through. Of the rest of the terrific cast, Bob Odenkirk as Ben Bagdikian, Bradley Whitford as Arthur Parsons, Bruce Greenwood as Robert McNamara, \nTracy Letts as Fritz Beebe, David Cross as Howard Simons, Michael Stuhlbarg as Abe Rosenthal & Carrie Coon as Meg Greenfield, stand out.On the whole, 'The Post' is a winner all the way. This is a timely film, that needs to be watched, that including the ego-maniac sitting in the White House. Strongly Recommended!"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "I would rate it as one of the best of 2017, and one of Spielberg's best in recent times. In this age of 'fake news' its a reminder of the part that the free press plays in a democracy. Oscar worthy performance from Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Greetings again from the darkness. It's the first time a movie marquee has read \"Spielberg-Streep-Hanks\", so expectations are sky high - and rightly so. The result is level of cinematic preciseness we don't often see. As an added bonus, it also features both historical and contemporary relevance - the type of relevance that forces us to consider where we stand and what type of society we prefer. So for the price of a ticket, we get Hollywood star power, a history lesson, and current societal commentary ... now that's a holiday bargain!Meryl Streep stars as Katharine (Kay) Graham, the first female publisher of a major U.S. newspaper, and she delivers her most nuanced performance in years ... that of a conflicted woman coming to grips with her immense power at a time when many men believed she lacked the capacity for making such far-reaching and weighty decisions. Tom Hanks slides into the loafers of Ben Bradlee, the hard-charging editor of Ms. Graham's newspaper, The Washington Post. The role fits Hanks like a glove, and he even brandishes Bradlee's trademark growling speech pattern. Bradlee is laser-focused on what he believes is the right thing to do, and steadfast in his commitment to the cause.Of course, the dilemma faced by these two involved the Pentagon Papers scandal of 1971. The film kicks off with a quick timeline of the political maneuverings that led to, and escalated, the Vietnam War. When Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys) leaked documents from the Defense Department's study on decision-making during the Vietnam War, and the New York Times published some of the pages, the ramifications were numerous and the fallout was ugly. The complicated web of deceit and bad decisions spanned 5 Presidential administrations (Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon). It became obvious that those in power continued a war they knew we couldn't win. The cover-up was widespread and the string of lies were delivered by many. The government lost the people's faith, and then tried to crush the free press that had exposed its dirty secrets.It's only been a couple of years since SPOTLIGHT won the Oscar for Best Picture, and now that film's Oscar winning writer Josh Singer teams with Liz Hannah on a script that is elevated by an extraordinary cast and crew. We get the real feel of the organized chaos of a newsroom, and it's a thing of beauty. The clacking of typewriters, exuberant phone conversations, and a cloud of cigarette smoke all blend to create the fabric of an institution designed and intended to deliver the truth. As with all things, it's never quite so simple. We learn of the historical collusion between press and politics, as reporters and editors comingled with politicians, only to draw the line when deemed necessary. Both sides have flaws, yet as citizens, we simply can't tolerate the government manipulating and even quashing the free press - a free press designed to protect the governed, not those that govern (per the Supreme Court decision).Spielberg has delivered a master class of ethics vs legalities vs political power, touching on not just the responsibilities of all parties, but most crucially on the conflicting objectives of a free press (making money) and the government system (getting elected) it is charged with holding accountable. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (two time Oscar winner, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, SCHINDLER'S LIST) captures the authenticity of the newsroom, the intimacy of private discussions, and the fascinating look back at typesetting machines and a newspaper delivery system that silently forces us to recognize the power of today's internet.As you would expect, the supporting cast is remarkable and deep. Bradley Whitford, Bruce Greenwood (as Robert McNamara), Alison Brie (Kay's daughter), Carrie Coon (reporter Meg Greenfield), Sarah Paulson (as Bradlee's wife), Jesse Plemons (attorney Roger Clark), and Michael Stuhlbarg (as NY Times publisher Abe Rosenthal) all bring realism to their roles. Two particular standouts are Tracy Letts (Ms. Coon's real life husband) as Kay Graham's trusted advisor Fritz Beebe, and Bob Odenkirk as The Post reporter Ben Bagdikian who meets with Ellsberg. Gender inequality of the era is front and center for many scenes - sometimes even a bit too showy or distracting. The prime example is the scene where Ms. Graham is leaving the Supreme Court through a sea of silently admiring women - an unbelievably disproportionate crowd make-up. The gender point is made clearly through the position of Kay Graham and her actions, and no further proverbial slaps upside the head were required for the audience to \"get it\". A rare Hindenburg joke is tossed in, and Bradlee is referred to as a pirate ... two attempts to lighten the mood on a story that deserves serious attention. Composer John Williams' score is never over the top, and perfectly complements the various conversations throughout. The film is quite clearly meant to impress how history repeats itself = those in power believing they are above all, while the free press tries to expose the abuses. It also makes the point that we as citizens must remain vigilant in our pursuit of the truth, as all sides have an agenda ... sometimes it's as complicated as covering up bad decisions, while other times it's as simple as driving up the stock price. With its cliffhanger ending, Spielberg's film could be viewed as a prequel to the fantastic 1976 film ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, and that's pretty lofty company."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Economic, specific, brilliant. That should be enough to sing the praises of a work of art but in \"The Post\" there is more. much more. We can't ignore the fact imposed by the historical moment we're living right now. The press under attack. Belittled, insulted but not ignored. No, never that. Steven Spielberg puts everything at the service of the story and the magic stroke is Meryl Streep. She creates a real life woman again, after Margaret Thatcher, Julia Childs, Lindy Chamberlain and once again she creates a fully fledged human being and this time she plays a woman without a known voice until she finds it and when she does, she uses it. I'm absolutely transfixed and moved very moved by her performance"}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "The Pentagon Papers saga is a story worth telling. Unfortunately, it gets sidelined here so the film can heap (well-deserved) praise on The Washington Post. There is no question that the Pentagon Papers and the legally-stymied New York Times rescued the Post from parochial doldrums and vaulted it to national significance. And changing the title from \"The Papers\" to \"The Post\" reveals that the filmmakers' intent was primarily to tell the story of the newspaper and less the significance of the cover-up that spawned it. Because of that, however, we really never quite understand the over-riding importance of the clandestine operation The Post was describing. Without it, \"The Post\" is just a well-told story of how another liberal news outlet upheld the First Amendment. There's been no shortage of those.Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks dominate the film... well, the first half at least. Then slowly their own personae crept in. When Streep as Katherine Graham was the uncertain, conflicted socialite publisher, still in the shadow of her long-dead father and more recently deceased husband, she inhabited the role. We looked past Streep and believed in her. But as she slowly gained her confidence, she kept losing her identity, and the strong Meryl Streep came through. Likewise. Hanks as editor Ben Bradlee started out uncharacteristically conflicted as the man who stridently sees his mission, yet still must answer to a woman he clearly at once respects and still resents. As the film wears on, however, Bradlee's position becomes more desperate and even more manipulative; it was the familiar everyman-strongman Hanks who shines through. Considering the intent of the film - to herald The Post - this isn't necessarily bad, but given that we already know - historically - how the situation played out, it was hardly suspenseful. Streep was good, but she has been better - The Iron Lady, The Devil Wears Prada. Hanks was quite credible, but it wasn't Captain Phillips or Bridge of Spies. Special note goes to Bob Odenkirk, who turned a very nuanced, self-effacing performance. He could easily have been Jimmy (Better Call Saul) - there are so many parallels. But he wasn't. A good film - a very worthy effort - but not a great one. The liberal cheerleaders are slobbering all over this picture and rushing to draw comparisons to Trump vs the press (a stretch at best), and they aren't wrong in their critical assessments. Just overly exuberant."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "Much to my surprise, I found Spielberg's account of the Washington Post's constitutional battle with the Nixon Administration over the Post's audacious and impulsive decision to publish the leaked Pentagon Papers in 1971 to be mildly prosaic and detached. It definitely lacks the raw drama it was obviously angling for and key scenes came across as tentative and sloppy.Despite an impactful, committed performance by Meryl Streep as Katharine Graham, the publisher of the Washington Post who helped crush gender barriers in journalism and a lively turn by Tom Hanks as the brash and swaggering Ben Bradlee, editor of the Post, this film suffers from a lack of depth and a surprisingly scattershot approach to the story by Spielberg. A viewer would be forgiven for coming away with a flawed understanding of the Pentagon Papers because the film is more about how the Washington Post came into national prominence by defying the White House in publishing documents the government claimed as top secret and vital to U.S. military success in Vietnam.Some might argue that this film should be watched and evaluated more deliberately but when Spielberg himself rushed through the material and the filmmaking process, it's harder to claim that the viewer has missed something. With this much proven talent on both sides of the camera, haste makes waste. Not recommended."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Steven Speilberg hasn't wowed me in quite some time so I was hoping for something more from this effort. His latter films have produced great performances but not really the wholly engaging films that I seek. I also think Ready Player One looks fairly atrocious, so I was hoping The Post would at least be good. After viewing the film, I will say that I enjoyed this quite a bit. In a similar vein to Zodiac and Spotlight the film is areally smart craft (although not as thrilling).The film is about the real life leaking of the Pentagon Papers, which detail the United States' involvement in Vietnam even prior to the Vietnam War. At the time the Washington Post is a small scale paper that gets a hold of the story and decides whether to leak the involvement or suffer the same fate of the New York Times who had their freedom of press threatened by then president Richard Nixon. Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, and Steven Speilberg surprisingly all work together for the very first time.The film is detailed and there are little intricacies within the plot that you can miss if your attention wanders. The film actually has many talented performers which is nice to see. Everyone here is good. Tom Hanks (the nice cool uncle you always wish you had) is typically good, same with Streep. I'm quite a fan of politically based drama's if they are done with attention, style, and substance. I feel like The Post brings that after a lukewarm start.The film doesn't have the same knife edge tension like Zodiac, however there is strength in the script and delivery. Its intentional that this film is easily comparable to what is going on today and Trump's war on \"fake news\". I'm happy to say this is Speilberg's best film in a long time.

In the era of Trump, the most dangerous man ever to hold the office of President of the United States, and who has declared war on all media that does not wrap him up in utter adulation or (worse) question or criticize him and his administration that seeks to turn the country into a corporate theocracy, a free press is needed more than ever before. Here is an administration that has slashed every agency created to protect our environment and the population; replaced scientists with big oil executives; replaced the head of our public school system with a woman who despises the public school system and believes in \"Christian indoctrination\" for our children (not to mention vouchers for private Christian schools); alienated our allies in the UN and NATO; called all immigrants \"a danger to society\"; demands Mexico pays for a useless wall on our southern border; calls voters and states who did not support him \"the enemy\" (how many times has Trump visited California during the wildfires? Hint: Zero); declared Jerusalem as the capital of one of our only two \"allies\" left (that and Russia), thereby kicking the hornet's nest and unleashing the possibility of terrorist incidents abroad and in the US, which will be a lead up to a Middle East war that his VP and many in Congress want to allow Jesus to return; sought the end of net neutrality as the cornerstone in media control (the elimination of all media that does not allow him to run the country like a King or Dictator will surely follow); and is our very own Greg Stillson (for those familiar with Stephen King's novel) toying with nuclear weapons (\"what's the use of having them if we can't use them\") and getting into countless pissing matches with North Korea. There are mornings when I am surprised to wake up. The election of Donald Trump in November 2016 will go down as the biggest stain on the history of this country.Back to the film: All involved with this sensational \"small\" (in Spielberg standards) film clearly saw the danger Trump presents to the non-right wing nut media, and the country and world, and put their hearts and souls into the project. Streep once again has mastered the mannerisms of her character in her portrayal, and Hanks fills Jason Robards' shoes as Ben Bradlee (although I also could have seen Michael Keaton in the role). Bob Odenkirk brings a touch of Jimmy McGill eccentricity to his role as Ben Bagdikian. The screenplay is genius in how it incorporates scenes of Nixon (seen in the White House as a silhouette) screaming about how unfairly he is being treated, and his threats \"not to allow the Washington Post near the White House again,\" could have easily been uttered by our current President. The President is not Above the Law. He is supposed to be elected by the people (although Citizens United has blurred that), and he is not a King. This film, as previous films such as All the President's Men and Frost/Nixon, reminds us. A free press is the cornerstone to a thriving democracy. I could not help but noticing the number of down-votes for a film that is not in wide release yet. Once again, anything that criticizes the King (in his mind) with No Clothes is \"fake news\" to the brainwashed rubes.

The cinematography, color grading, set designs, and even costumes are all incredible. Spielberg's camerawork in this film is absolutely incredible, and he absolutely deserves to be at least nominated for best director (not that the Oscars really mean anything). The camera seemingly has omnipotence in this film, panning and moving throughout each and every scene until it decides to stop and rest on whatever Spielberg feels like focusing on. His scenes either seem to consist of short close ups, or long takes where the camera subtly but effectively moves throughout the set. His camerawork is matched by the skill of the actors and actresses working together for this movie, as 'The Post' undoubted has the most impressive cast of any film this year, with each and every role being played masterfully. Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, as always, are perfect. The story of this film starts off confusing, filled with strange jargon and mentions of people who I personally did not know, but eventually it settles down into somewhat of a thriller mixed with a very compelling drama. If it isn't obvious yet, I love this movie to death. It does have issues: one that is the worst offender is the terrible photoshopped pictures shown throughout the movie. The worst being one with Streep's character hanging out with the Kennedys. The fact that 'Forrest Gump', which came out over 20 years ago, can make it seem like Forrest was in archival footage flawlessly yet this film can't even correctly photoshop pictures is pretty embarrassing. The only other technical problem I have is a scene that takes place in a courtroom uses some really bad CGI and CGI lighting that reminded me of the Star Wars prequels. Besides these issues, I think the film gets a little cheesy near the end, and this cheesiness is eccentuated by an even cheesier score.

Regardless of how one feels about the story, the underlying politics of the time, the persons, etc. this is a must-see moview if for nothing else by its craft."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "THE POST (2017) *** out of ***\nThe Post distinguishes itself from other investigative journalism pictures like Spotlight and All the President's Men. Spotlight looked too much like a television production but it still delivered a powerful presentation about a tragic global subject while All the President's Men had the full fluidity of cinema contained within it and is a timeless classic. The Post falls somewhere in between. The first hour dragged too much for me but the second half burned rubber as it raced to a satisfying climax and conclusion. You accept the shortcomings of the first half when it's all said and done and it turns out to be an absorbing \"mini\" classic. Spielberg, Hanks and Streep are not nominated for any guild awards and their chances of being Oscar nominated are about 50/50 and I would say that Streep has the best chance of any of them but I do predict that it will be nominated for best picture strictly based on its historical perspective. However, it is starting to look like Spielberg's directorial style and especially the camera work he supervises is becoming a mirror image of itself. Spielberg needs to re-invent himself at some point but after 40+ years of making films you have to ask yourself if that is even possible. He has nothing left to prove and is one of the best film makers and story tellers of all time if not *the* best."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "In 1994 Ron Howard directed a movie called \"The Paper\", and in 1976 there was a little film directed by Alan J. Pakula called \"All the President's Men\". I think \"The Post\" could be considered a mash-up of the two movies, with a heavy emphasis on the latter movie (even the newsroom set looks identical).\"The Post\" takes place in mid-1971, weeks before The Washington Post's initial public offering on the \"American Stock Exchange\". At the time, the company, headed by former publisher Philip Graham's widow, Katharine (played exceptionally well by Ms. Streep) was more or less considered a \"small community newspaper\"; constantly being one-upped by the golden child of newspapers: The New York Times. Just after Katherine Graham took over as publisher, she appointed seasoned newsman Benjamin Bradlee as managing editor, played here by Spielberg favorite Tom Hanks. When the \"Pentagon Papers\" were leaked in early 1971, The Washington Post found themselves, once again, on the outside looking in. For three months, The New York Times sat on the massive story while they researched it, putting all their ducks in a row until they published part one of a four part series on June 18, 1971. Thousands of pages of a top-secret, commissioned report that proved a mass government cover-up, spanning at least four presidents was going to be, without a doubt the biggest story of the decade. To Bradlee and the rest of his staff, not being apart of it was unacceptable: they wanted in on the scoop and were willing to risk their freedom, and the future of the newspaper, to report on it. Ms. Graham, however, wasn't as gung-ho. She had plenty to worry about - investor relations, her family's legacy, and badmouthing her \"friends\" inside the government, namely former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (played by Canadian Bruce Greenwood) who had a big role in the cover-up. This is a fast-moving film that, in just under two-hours, covers weeks of back-and-forth conversations and research and a back story we may never completely know or understand. Does it really matter here? No. This is a great film, and and entertaining film that depicts how The Washington Post played a strategic role in one of the biggest news stories in the 1970's, and earned itself acclaim as an important national newspaper. As a former member of the media I am a strong supporter of, and a true believer in the First Amendment, and in Canada, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. So I enjoy depictions of such in movies (The People vs. Larry Flynt, 1996, is another one you could see). I don't care how historically accurate the story is or isn't (in this case it's debatable, however they do use some of the real recordings of President Nixon's phone conversations). I'd watch hearings on C-SPAN live if I wanted historical records. \"The Post\" is a movie and gets the point across. There is, and will forever be, dramatic elements added to true stories - this is the entertainment business. As we see in the movie toward the end, The Washington Post (the company) is a large part of the reason why the media industry as a whole can continue to report on similar stories, or even why IMDb can publish this little piece by little 'ol me. Free speech. So true is The Washington Post's motto today, Democracy Dies in Darkness."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Again, a strangely inappropriate rating on IMDB. Granted that towards the end this excellently made film - in every aspect, became a bit gooey. But I have never sat in a theater where the audience erupted in applause not once, not twice, but three times. Mr. Spielberg, claps speak louder than words. Well done."}, {"score": "1/10", "review": "I am not sure, maybe it was because I was tired, but this movie was tragically slow paced. Fell asleep a few times, did not finish it because I was awoken by a worker, who told me that I was snoring. I apologized and left."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "The latest Steven Spielberg film \"The Post\" is a nice showcase of the real life 1970's battle between government and journalist which would go to the highest court in the land(The U.S. Supreme Court). The film shows how information is uncovered and leaked about the highly criticized \"Vietnam War\".All of us want freedom of speech and freedom of press, and us as people expect the news media to give it to us and when documents are uncovered by people in the press which exposes cover up and lies from many previous presidents, you feel relieved and mad also. And with this picture it shows the process of how to investigate and publish hard hitting truth even if it means to challenge the powers that be.That's what \"The Washington Post\" did as the owner a powerful woman in Kay Graham(a wonderful Meryl Streep)put it all on the line with the help of a powerful and well know editor in Ben Bradlee(the good Tom Hanks). As anything worth exposing and challenging is worth a fight for as it makes the powerful upset and angry.Overall this picture is a must watch for political history buffs also as it shows how the ever on going war between media and government began and how it became a political dogfight for each and all involved. Proving that accountability is needed for all."}]
