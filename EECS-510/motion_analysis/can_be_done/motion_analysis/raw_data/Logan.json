[{"score": "10/10", "review": "The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film. While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.The film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. The performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.Overall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "The beginning scene teases us with violence which pleases us R rated fans and we do see many more gore. It really is different from the xmen films, I felt the characters in this one, the connection, the relationship. It was worth watching. The final wood scene is thrilling towards the end. The only thing that upset me was the villain that Wolverine faces. It's a perfect send off for Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "LOGAN - SPOILER FREE REVIEWAs most of you are aware I have not been a huge fan of the latest X- Men outings, but THIS WAS AWESOME!In a rather bleak entry we see a Post X-Men Logan, something has happened and the mutants no longer exist or there is a few of them out there. Director James Mangold chose to make the film almost colorless with much, much more character development than previous Wolverine and X-Men movies. We see a tired character that no longer belongs in a world that has feared him for over a century.While Hugh Jackman in his last outing as Logan does an amazing job and proves once and for all why NO ONE ELSE can ever be Wolverine, the supporting cast does a superb job as well starting with Sir Patrick Stuart who returns as Charles Xavier, Boyd Holbrook (Netflix's NARCOS) as an astounding and dangerous antagonist and newcomer Dafne Keen who is a rather sweet but incredibly deadly Weapon X-23.The movie is filled with gore and violence, but it does not feel forced at all in such an obscure movie. There is a rather new trend in Comic Book Movies after DEADPOOL, make them as brutal as possible, and while this started in the 90s with THE CROW and BLADE it has gained some track and more R Rated CBM are being developed as we speak.I HIGHLY recommend it."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Logan is the Wolverine movie that fans have always wanted, it packs in great emotional story telling and is littered with gritty, violent action sequences that only Wolverine can be worthy of, while at the same time handling the end and departure of beloved characters in such a great way. Humour was also very sparingly sprinkled in to Logan making it an overall amazing package.It was a true sendoff for a hero as we tie an end to Logan's legacy and leave behind Laura (X-23) to potentially carry on the mantle of Wolverine. Unlike the usual action-packed comic-book superhero movie this was comparatively subtle but contains doses of insane fight sequences that tops many that we've seen perhaps due to the well deserved R-rating. But surprisingly this movie manages to not only succeed on that front but also in telling this story that is really a lot more meaningful than the classic or even clich\u00e9d good versus evil that is slowly becoming overused and boring, so Logan really was just a fresh of fresh air among many other accolades that is achieves.The chemistry that develops between our trio of characters is great, the way Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman portray these old and worn- out characters is great. Especially Hugh Jackman as Logan, when you see this character, his posture and in his eyes there really is just the word 'tired' that comes to mind and the way that Jackman manages to get that across in this film is truly heart wrenching, the hopelessness that is felt by these characters can really be seen on these characters' facial expression. This actress who portrays Laura should also be applauded for the way she portrays this character that would sure to be compared to the brilliant portrayal of 'Eleven' from stranger things by Millie Bobby Brown. Another class act from a child-actress. The tone that is established through the actors and atmosphere is truly breathtaking and sombre. As a comic book fan it really is a blessing to see the \"Old man Logan\" title be explored and reimagined to the big-screen in such a way. This movie shows the other superhero movies what a superhero movie could be and adds another to the list of R- rated films that are necessary of that rating and delivers beautifully under the category. In my opinion perhaps this is the next direction for superhero movies as people are starting to grow tired of the colourful capes and Leotards, just look at the change that has been done in the comic book world, darker tales and growingly gritty violence, perhaps the next step for superhero movies to evolve and adapt is by going in this direction, targeting a more mature audience."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Given how this website seems to have for some reason a world limit.

In a world where Deadpool set the gold standard, Logan grabs the genre by the balls & delivers a master class in how it's done, even without all the bells and whistles, blood and chaos (of which there is a lot) that comes with it's R-rating. For fans of the Old Man Logan graphic novel, Mangold delivers on that familiar tone and feel in what ultimately plays out to be a gritty yet emotive character driven piece. We get to see both Hugh Jackman & Patrick Stewart give the finest performances of their often overcrowded & muddled X-Men careers and can only be saddened at the thought of the things that could have been if this was something that the franchise had offered in the beginning. However, we do get to see a passing of the torch so to speak with the introduction of everyone's favourite adamantium wielding, blood thirsty, pre teen clone Laura Kinney aka X-23 who is not just the catalyst to the entire story but the glue that holds it together in the most explosive and violent of ways....and we loved every second of it.

I recommend this film and I'd also like to see the rating stay high for an age. So vote/rate!! the movie after viewing for yourself.10/10 for me"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Seventeen years and eight films after he first donned the iconic mutton chops and sharpened those adamantium claws, Hugh Jackman is back one last time in his most iconic role of Wolverine in Logan. With the ominous tagline 'His time has come' looming over the film, my hopes were that they'd be able to do both the character and Jackman justice after the two solo outings we've had so far have left a lot to be desired.The year is 2029 and there hasn't been a mutant born for twenty-five years. Attempting to hide from his life and legacy, Logan (Hugh Jackman) lives on the Mexican border providing care for an ailing Professor X (Patrick Stewart).With his powers dwindling, Logan is approached to help with Laura (Dafne Keen), a young mutant being pursued by dark forces. bringing everything he tried to put in the past right back to the fore.First thing that struck me about Logan was just how different a take on the character this was going to be. Sure, he's always had anger issues but we have never seen him in this state before, constant pain and deteriorating powers making him a shadow of his former self. Right from the off we are thrown into a scenario that perfectly sets the tone for the film about to unfold, it's subtly comical yet brutally violent, making me so glad we finally have an R rated Wolverine film.The violence isn't unnecessary either, supporting a more realistic portrayal of Logan taking down his enemies. It also helps the action sequences flow better, rather than having to cut away every time someone gets stabbed in the head the camera can linger a little longer on the mess Logan and X-23 leave in their wake, one long take in particular towards the end gloriously showing Wolverine at his devastating best. It's at this moment that I have to thank the success of Deadpool, which led to the studio giving James Mangold the chance to do an untamed version of this character, Mangold in full control of the reins mirroring Logan fulfilling his brutal potential.The difference in quality between The Wolverine, which Mangold also directed, and Logan is quite staggering really and you can certainly tell Mangold was in full control of the story this time round. The former descended into a typically over-the-top CGI-fest of a finale whereas Logan takes its time to build a study of this beaten down hero before climaxing with a heartfelt and personal finale that makes it much more of an involving film for the audience. The theme of parenthood has been explored a little with this character before, his relationship with Rogue in the first two X-Men films however, none of them have been quite like this, Mangold's homage to the old school Westerns playing out fascinatingly well as Logan plays out. The real dirt and grit of a Western etched with Logan's past is felt through John Mathieson's quite wonderful cinematography while the adventure of it all is encapsulated in Marco Beltrami's score.Coming to the performances, Logan features the best turn from Hugh Jackman in the role to date, and you can tell with his performance and promotion of the film that this is something he's always wanted to do with the character. Jackman's dedication to the role is admirable and I don't think he's ever done a bad job in any of the films, it's just that when a performance like this comes along in a film of this quality, it's hard not to put it above the rest. Patrick Stewart returns as Professor X, himself not in the best of places, and it's a very good and touching performance from a man who's also done a lot in making the X-Men films what they are. I found I had to get used to the pair of them swearing so much but when I did, the two are really quite funny, particularly together.The breakout performance from Dafne Keen as Laura/X-23 is one of the most impressive ones we will see all year, offering an innocent yet vicious portrayal of such a powerful little girl. She speaks very few words, using her facial expressions more to convey her emotions and she rather impressively gives Jackman a run for his money when it comes to the action sequences. The rest of the supporting cast, most notably Boyd Holbrook as Donald Pierce and Stephen Merchant as Caliban, make the most of their screen time, even if Holbrook does fall foul to the comic-book movie villain curse. This is Jackman's film though so focusing more on his last outing was always going to happen.Logan certainly does justice to both the character and Hugh Jackman himself with a film that steps away from the superhero norm and offers a personal and emotionally fuelled outing that certainly brings the violence and delivers one of the best comic-book films I've seen."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Few anticipated the mammoth success of Deadpool last year. With a fraction of the typical budget for superhero fare, an audience-prohibiting R-rating (presumably box-office poison), and the lack of a Summer release date, it had none of the hallmarks of reliably profitable cinema. And yet, Deadpool hit a nerve. Positive reviews, gargantuan box office takings, and the collective adoration of most who saw it. It seemed that people didn't want their violence sanitised, and their action films humourless - who'da thunk it? As with all unexpected hits, Hollywood learns from its mistakes and dutifully attempts to emulate the success of these breakout box office anomalies. After Star Wars destroyed the box office, countless ripoffs emerged, and similar things occurred after The Matrix, Jaws, Indiana Jones, American Pie, Paranormal Activity (blegh) and the list goes on. In the case of Deadpool this is a very good thing - Hollywood seems to be putting far more faith in producing big budget films with big R ratings. Logan is the first to follow Deadpool's wake, and like its predecessor, it wears its R rating like a badge of honour. The curiously bloodless stabbings of Wolverine in his previous PG 13 outings are out - now we are treated to spectacularly gory Adamantium-fuelled fight scenes that are utterly thrilling and cathartic. Importantly, the violence isn't just cheap thrills - it actually serves to contribute a real sense of stakes to the plot, making you really feel and understand the mortality of these mutants, that violence is ugly, brutal and most importantly painful. We are also treated to profanity, which once again is not exploited, merely a reflection of Logan's age and weariness, as he approaches the latter stages of life. Aside from some uncharacteristic swearing from Professor Xavier (which felt gratuitous) and a scene with totally arbitrary bare breasts, Logan's R rating is effectively utilised for the service of its story, which is far darker, meaner and more mature than other X Men related films. An aspect that really worked well was the inclusion of Laura, a girl with formidable powers that prompts Logan to seek heroic redemption and rediscover his sense of purpose (albeit rockily.) Steely, tough and mostly mute, Laura is the antithesis of a cute movie kid - she takes no prisoners, and leaves no throat unstabbed, a terrifically entertaining character. As such, her uneasy union with Logan is believable and unexpectedly emotional, grounding the film in pathos usually absent from superhero movies. Also adding emotional resonance is Patrick Stewart, in fine, gracious and ever so fragile form as Charles Xavier, who is reduced to a consuming neurological disease stemming from his telekinesis - he has easy chemistry with Jackman, complemented by the years of baggage contributed by almost 2 decades of X Men films. Finally to Hugh Jackman himself - he is a stellar vessel, playing Logan as he has never done before, with vulnerability, brusqueness and a surly resolve, he carries the movie amply with a layered, sophisticated performance that is worthy of end of year awards consideration (unlikely as that may be.) In the first act villainous characters are effective, because they appear only as hired guns led by a menacing Boyd Holbrook. This simplicity feels appropriate for James Mangold's pared back, realistic vision of the X Men-populated world, a factor achieved through the grounded nature of characters, and very cleverly through the existence of X Men comics, almost implying that the films that preceded are an airbrushed, more idyllic, fictionalised version of the truth of the X Men. Critics have called the film like a Western, considering its setting, its brutality, and a particular scene that directly references Shane (1953). On these bases, the film proceeds with gusto, yet falters when far more melodramatic, far-reaching elements to the films antagonists are introduced. As followed through by a wasted Richard E Grant, the villains, and their back story, while interesting, feels incongruous with the gritty, realistic main narrative and its effectively more concentrated scope. It also adds more fat to the already bulging story, which feels bloated and not entirely coherent, at a slightly overlong 2 hrs 17 minutes. Furthermore, a sequence involving a family who invites Logan, Laura and Xavier to dinner after they assisted them on the highway, and its culmination was profoundly irritating - as a result of the morally iffy actions of Xavier in particular it is very difficult to sympathise with him immediately after, despite the fact that the film seems to want you to do so. Nonetheless, the film builds towards a satisfying climax that feels like a fitting end to Logan's journey, that is unless Jackman decides to return once more. In all James Mangold's film is bold, brash, gloriously mean and feverishly exciting ride that is certainly the most audacious and enjoyable superhero film I've seen in quite some time, perhaps since The Dark Knight or Watchmen, and few who see it will be disappointed. Logan delivers what you'd expect from a rollicking action flick starring Wolverine, but what you might not expect is an equally satisfying drama of characters and relationships, which explores age, regret, duty and redemption in powerful fashion."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "couldn't have ended the legacy better .. unreal performance by hugh jackman and he carries the burden with him throughout the movie and his agony and misery is something that needs to be experienced .. the movie stays with you long after it has ended .. one of the best superhero movies of all time"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "For years we have seen Hugh Jackman play the character of Wolverine, and I have now seen possibly his final performance as the character in Logan and I loved it. The premise sees an older more damaged Logan taking care of an ill Charles Xavier, when they encounter a new young mutant who they must protect from dark forces. Hugh Jackman reprises his iconic role as Logan and I think this may be his best ever, he is clearly a more aged, impatient version of the character and you totally buy his more pessimistic viewpoint on life at the beginning of the film. I love his character growth throughout the film and you buy the emotion he conveys from this truly emotional gut wrenching performance that is award worthy. Patrick Stewart plays Xavier again in this film and he is brilliant in this much different damaged performance. We are used to seeing Stewart as the confident wise teacher but in this film he is ill, damaged and broken and it is such an interesting take on the character that Stewart nails out of the park. Dafne keen plays Laura the young girl in this film and she is great in this film especially considering it is her first ever role. Her, Jackman and Stewarts chemistry is fantastic in this film and I really did buy their little dysfunctional family that slowly grows. Plus she is absolutely great in the action scenes along with Jackman. Boyd Holbrook plays the villain in this film and he was pretty good in this film, he was menacing when he wanted to be and cocky when he wanted to be. I also thought Stephen merchant did a pretty good job as Caliban even though he isn't in this film that much. The story of this film is a very simple escort mission to get laura to safety and it really works, the emotion between the characters carries this story and really makes you care about them and the situation that they are put into. The script has some great dramatic dialogue that does sell the dire straights that these characters are in as they try to survive in the world. There is very little humour in the film but what is there did make me chuckle a bit and in a real way. The style of the film is very dark and despondent which really works for the situation that the characters are in and the awesome gritty bloody violence that has been needed in a wolverine film forever. However, my one negative for this film is that it is a little too long and I feel like there are some real pacing issues that make this film feel even longer then it actually is. Overall though I loved this film and I urge anybody who is a fan of wolverine or just good movies that you have to see this film."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Logan is an absolutely fantastic film, and the decision make this an R rated movie made it even better. The action, blood and gore were not overdone, and the fight scenes were executed perfectly. Logan is easily one of the best comic book films ever made. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Dafne Keen were all superb in their roles, and if they do cast someone else as Wolverine in the future I hope they take their time and make sure the person they choose to carry on the mantle of Wolverine can do him justice."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "It's third time lucky for the Wolverine, because we've finally got a solo movie for the X-Men's most beloved character that fully achieves what it sets out to do. Intensely violent and gritty from start to finish, Logan is a thrilling and powerfully dramatic film that finally brings the gravitas and depth worthy of such a great character, making for an utterly exhilarating watch.The greatest thing about Logan, however, is the fact that it's not a superhero movie. Yes, there's some amazing action and allusions to the X-Men universe, but at its core, this is an out-and-out character piece focusing on Logan as he grows more tired and weary of his long and guilt-ridden life.However, that makes it absolutely fascinating to watch, and brings a level of dramatic depth and intrigue that we've never seen before in the comic book genre. From start to finish, Hugh Jackman does an incredible job at bringing his character's exhaustion to light, giving a gritty and battle-hardened performance that fits in perfectly with the film's heavy-going tone, and makes the dramatic assessment of the character all the more powerful.And what's more is that the Wolverine is a very different person in this film than the one we know from the main X-Men movies. Whilst he's still got a gruff strength and personality, there's a lot less focus on his charisma as a superhero and more on how he has begun to struggle quite seriously with his inner demons over the last decade or so, something amazingly apparent on screen, and finally achieving a compelling detailing of the character's guilt, unlike the previous two Wolverine solo outings.Alongside Hugh Jackman are two other fantastic performances. Patrick Stewart is stunning in a very nuanced and often even hard-to-watch turn as a Charles Xavier struggling with a degenerative brain disease, verging on death. His performance matches the dramatic heft of Jackman's, and adds significantly to the film's tender and emotional core, which was brilliant to see.Also, Dafne Keen is unexpectedly brilliant as the young mutant who Wolverine and Xavier take in. I won't give anything away, but I have to say that the young actress does a fantastic job in a very wide- ranging performance. She brings some excellent comic relief at moments, she barely speaks a word throughout the movie, instead bringing the darker side of her character's story through in a subtly powerful performance, and she works fantastically in the action sequences.One other person that we mustn't forget ti commend for this film is the director: James Mangold. Although he brought a fun, blockbuster image to The Wolverine, what he does with Logan is truly stunning. This movie's main objective is to be a quiet, intelligent and powerfully dramatic experience whilst mixing with an action and crime-oriented plot. It may sound simple, but the only time we've seen such a feat pulled off before is Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight.However, Mangold does the job exceptionally with Logan, and brings that powerfully gritty and emotionally heavy-going atmosphere to the film in such a bold manner. This movie has no qualms about being exceptionally violent and dark, nor does it ever cheapen its quieter, more human story with superhero movie tropes, and that's what makes it such a compelling, exciting, powerful and thrillingly original film."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Well, just got back from the cinema, and i have a grin on my face.This is truly a worthy end for the wolverine franchise, the character that Hugh Jackman has played so well for 17 years now. He has said this was his last film in the x-men universe, this movie is his goodbye. Jackman IS and forever will be, wolverine, and whoever is going to fill his shoes, is in for quite a challenge. And in this film Jackman plays wolverine better than ever, near perfectly balancing between the rage and bloodlust that drives him, and that of trying to be a decent person.Patrick Stewart has also announced this was his final x-men film, and taking into consideration that i think this might be the best x-men film to date, and one of the best superhero films ever made, Logan is a must see for all superhero fans.Pretty much every actor does a fine job in this film, And to my surprise, a totally unknown actress blew my mind. The young Dafne Keen. Oh my god, a 11-12 year old girl that is a perfect cast for her role as Laura Kinney/x-23. I don't want to go too much into her role in this film, but she is amazing, truly amazing. Most fans of x-men probably know who Laura Kinney is, where she comes from, and what she is. It is really disturbing and fascinating at the same time, to watch a little girl play a savage beast, and she nails it like a experienced professional.As most know this movie is set in 2029, where wolverine takes care of an old Xavier. There seem to be few mutants left on earth and they just try and stay away from everyone, but of course, this is not meant to last. Evil corporations and military hunts mutants down and kill and capture them. This forces an aging wolverine to give all he's got to try and protect what is left. And he is in for the battle of his life.Rated R, this movie is not exactly \"gentle\". In this film you will see heads being chopped off, limbs being parted, shotgun blasts to the head, and so on. It's a really brutal film, with lots of graphic imagery. And i love it, a savage like wolverine isn't exactly the guy you mess with. But wolverine isn't necessarily the biggest badass in this film. He has some serious competition this time.The action sequences are well made, the cinematography is good, the acting is good, the direction is good, the script is good, and the story is maybe the weakest part, but still good. But the whole movie is executed with care, and the decision to focus the entire story only on a few characters, was a very smart move.This is a movie that is lifted one step up by Jackman and Keen, Two actors several decades apart in age. They are the perfect team, and they make this one hell of a finale. I urge every fan of comics and superheros to go see this film.8/10 - Good"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Before Logan was released, there was not a single movie in my opinion from both Marvel and Dc, that could match the Dark Knight in quality. Sure there were commendable films that were close such as The Winter Soldier but they were still a far cry from the level that was presented by TDK. In my opinion, FOX have finally done it and have produced the closest movie in terms of genre-breaking and story-telling. They have surpassed the loopholes and issues surrounding their previous movies and so have transcended to a different domain of story-telling and entertainment. Logan attempts to break genres just like TDK did, by not following the rules of traditional superhero movies. Instead of big budgets, explosions and intergalactic journeys, we get a character-driven drama which attempts to show how the wolverine film was meant to be made, both in action and plot. We see that Logan is both vulnerable and broken; hes not the same as he was once before.Despite all the good scenes we have of Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart, the person who stole the spotlight, was none other than X- 23 actress, Dafne Keen. Her action scenes will blow you away, you have not seen a young girl as brutal and bad-ass as her! It is quite a slow and long piece, but in my opinion it worked as a final film for Hugh Jackman and it makes perfect sense. Though not perfect and still not as good as TDK, because while the acting of Boyd Holbrook as the villain was great he just wasn't a memorable threat towards the end. Other than that, I highly recommend this movie because like i said, it truly is something else and very unique for a superhero film.

Written, filmed and acted in such a way that it is much more than a superhero movie, it's far from your typical X-Men film. There is extreme gore and heavy swearing, but all of it fits perfectly without being forced into the film in an over the top way to make the most of an R/15 rating. The acting cannot be faulted across the board. Jackman has always portrayed the clawed X-Man well but this was by far his best performance, he makes it easy for the viewers to really feel Wolverine's pain and struggles as he ages. The same can be said for Patrick Stewart, portraying a 90 year old Charles Xavier suffering with Alzheimer's, his performance is truly believable and a much more emotional side of this beloved character is revealed. Dafne Keen is excellent, every expression and word from her is meaningful and further develops Laura's character. Hopefully we will see more of her in the future. The villains of this film are also very well crafted, their characters have meaning and aren't just villains for the sake of being villains which is the case in many comic book movies. The action scenes are everything you'd wish for in a Wolverine movie, with stunning camera shots making you feel like you're in the middle of the action. The music builds up tension well and puts an overall western vibe on the movie. Logan really is the movie Wolverine fans have been waiting for, with the R rating allowing Wolverine to be Wolverine, this film is adrenaline pumping. There are few times that comic book movies have featured effective emotional scenes, but thankfully Logan does this right. A genuinely good film, rather than a stereotypical superhero movie. It is obvious how much effort and care went into making Logan the masterpiece it is, an excellent job by everyone involved. Terrifically violent and beautifully emotional, a perfect send off for Hugh Jackman. 10/10"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Wow! This movie was quite the spectacle.. It felt like happiness, sadness, anger and very satisfied after seeing this movie. The movie is about Logan being completely broken down and very depressive. He has seen everything and experienced everything in life. Everything he loved and fought for have all been given to him, taken away,given back and taken away again. You see his journey in his eyes which is great. This is what you always wanted from wolverine. He said in the first x-men film that it hurt every time the claws came out and your finally felt that in this movie.. but the thing we all wanted to see is him going crazy... and boy did he.. I saw more blood, gore and amazinnggg action scenes throughout this movie than I could have ever wished for. The acting was great all-around, especially the little girl who had to act just through her expressions mostly without words. I was sure almost sure her action bits would be just full of annoying cuts every few seconds, but it wasn't.. there were some long-shots which really made me question how they filmed that. and yes.. i did let some tears fall out of my eyes. Im not gonna tell you whats gonna happen, but damn those were some emotional moments. the only negative i could come up with is maybe the slow pace in the middle, but i never got bored. Though it was a lot of showing wolverine is DONE with life itself, it was darn interesting to see him this way. The direction is amazing. You almost are in shock when you realize the director is the same one as knight and day with Cameron Dias HHS. This movie is another one, like the dark knight, that surpasses the brand great \"comic book film\" and can only be seen as A GREAT FILM PERIOD. All in All, one of the heaviest films fox ever brought out in recent times... Thank god for dead pool, because that's the reason we got this r-rated masterpiece. I would give this film a 9.9/10. It just missed some story points to make the middle 20 minutes not feel as a slow-burn. that's it.. this movie is so close to perfect its crazy."}, {"score": "4/10", "review": "TODAY this movie have 9.0 stars, which I am amaze of that , because non of the7 people I went to the movie like this movie at all, its lacking a lot, I think fans might have different opinion but definitely its an OK movie, you can wait to see it on Netflix, however, is early, I know I am not crazy, just trust on me, I go a lot to the movies, if you like XMEN and want to see the story, no matter what, you might enjoy the movie, but if you are a regular people, looking for a good commercial movie, mmmm you can skip this one. I usually don 't write reviews but this never is a 9.0, if when you read this is like 6.5 - 7.0 , then I will be OK"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "I'm emotionally devastated right now. I'm a fan of the \"X-Men\" saga and I heard this was Hugh Jackman's swansong to the character of Wolverine. Meaning he intends this to be his final time playing that part. And plus he is caring for a weak and humble Patrick Stewart. So I was already invested and a bit emotional going in because I got sad seeing these two characters in this state. These are people I care for and I feel like I know them at this point. There's been so many films with them and it all lead up to this moment. I wasn't sure if I was ready for it, but I went in and... It exceeded my expectations. I loved it. I'm not gonna spoil anything because I think you should see. I don't even know what to write really, I'm really speechless.This is a film that dares to go the extra mile and I applaud them for making an honest humble story and not this big extravaganza. Here the story and characters come first before all the action. Which I gotta say, The action was fantastic. It's extremely brutal and violent. Patrick Stewart gives a heartbreaking performance that's full of range. He is funny, crazy and wise. You feel really bad for him and seeing him be happy and remind Logan of the good values in life really got me. Hugh Jackman is phenomenal. This is \"THE\" performance from him.It's a tragic movie too. A lot of scenes actually made me teary eyed. There's so much in this that broke me that I'm still unable to shake the emotions off. This film is something special. I will say that this is the first time I've seen an entire audience stay until the credits ended. Why you ask? Well, because everyone was waiting for a Post-credit scene. There is no extra scene at the end, so you don't have to wait. Some guys started booing because there was nothing extra. I usually stay for the credits, but I don't think this movie needed an extra scene. It's perfect as it is. One negative I can find is that villain was stock. There's not much to him.That's it for now. I could talk about this film for hours, but I would have to go into Spoiler territory. My overall thoughts are that I think it's phenomenally exciting and heartbreaking. Go watch it."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Disclaimer: Chill no spoilers. However not your regular super hero movie. Keep your kids the hell away from it (It's rated R for a very good reason). Watching the movie felt like walking into your favorite bar full of good old friends & out of the blue, being punched hard in the gut for absolutely no reason. Brutal, shocking, uncomfortable, dazed & confused - making you keel over, wondering what's coming next. Take out the mutant powers & it borders around blurred lines of a gritty western & an art house production - stripped of all the glitz & glamour of the usual superhero flick, replaced by the depth possessed by almost none of its predecessors. Paced like a freight train, barreling through the landscape at some points & in others, slowing down at key stations to leisurely meander around & explore the main protagonists. Death is a dear friend, lurking around the corner, with battles so brutally bloody that no movie in superhero history comes close to its visceral viciousness. Constantly reminding you of the throbbing pain of that punch in the gut. Logan is withering & weary, Prof X is almost senile, all hope around is draining away awaiting death's sweet embrace. Enter a pint sized feral X-23 - electrifying the somber mood, relentlessly pursued by weaponized soldiers called Reavers, kicking off a chase reminiscent of T-2, except the John Connor kid here kicks (or should I say slices & dices) some serious ass. A few surprises thrown in, some well-timed but unexpected humor & then it all hurtles towards a satisfying finish. That gut feel, ebbs away when you walk out of the hall, but lingers on to ponder over. Recommended watch after any bad day at the office - except this time, you'll be ready to absorb that punch & mentally relish giving it back with razor sharp interest\""}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "This review of Logan is spoiler free**** (4/5)IF ONE COULD simply describe how old Wolverine the same way X-Men Origins: Wolverine showed it we would be here all day, describing different timelines from when he was born to when he had the adamantium enhancement. So we're just going to say that he is old, like really f*cking old, sure superpowers are one thing, but nobody ever said that he was impenetrable to tiredness, or said that he was invincible. Yes he can heal but now it takes a lot longer to heal his aged skin. In Logan Hugh Jackman's last time as the clawed mutant, he's tired, set six years after the sentinels killed thousands of mutants in X-Men: Days of Future Past we track Logan as a limo driver retired from the killing, having to look after another old codger, namely Patrick Stewart's Charles Xavier who now at 90 years-old is very frail, restricted to a wheelchair he barely remembers who he is, he has constant seizures that are more powerful than ever that can be stopped by medicine. He is spending retirement with his trusted friend, Caliban (Stephen Merchant), who's a mutant tracker he can sense a mutant from miles away, however he's always worried when Xavier has one of his seizures. It's here when Logan meets Laura (newcomer Dafne Keen), a mutant with extraordinary powers but also like Wolverine has a dark past this quickly comes to show, and essentially she uses her dark past to control her power. Logan soon sees that she is more powerful than he anticipated, using her two hand-claws to brutally attack oncoming killers. He has to travel cross-country to a paradise for mutants who the mute Laura, learned from a comic book Logan, is convinced that she made it up but he goes anyway lugging along tiredly through the roads. Director James Mangold's material showing the brutality of her past is powerful it shows that Wolverine isn't the only one with torture in his life. In addition he lives up to his promise by keeping the CGI to a minimum there's a slight ounce of CG here-and-there but compared to Marvel movies there's barely any. Mangold's technique here is not only in intricate detail of the character studies of Wolverine and Laura, but he's good with blood too the violence doesn't let up; sure there was violence in the previous X installments but nothing like this. There's splats of blood-and-guts everywhere it's sometimes unnerving, he Fs, he decapitates, he impales, and slashes - seemingly never-ending brutality here, Wolvie has been this bad-ass before in the other installments showing bloodless killings, but here we see the Wolverine we've been waiting for.However the film isn't perfect, there is a flaw in the second act the film slows it's momentum in a moment when Wolverine learns more about Laura, her abilities, her family, and her life learning what kind of person she is. Explaining a little slowly but all essential material to the third act as it picks up its pace again. It's here when the material gets a lot stronger, Logan now a lot more tired has to pull through one last fight against Holbrook's soft-speaking, yet brutal killing machine, it's here when Mangold inputs sentimentality as Wolvie is beginning to get weaker when his medicine wears off, he shows strength though but it's not enough going into the final few moments. Laura/X-23 fights alongside him with a team of child mutants, she shows strength too she has seen a lot in her young life and killing is the only thing she knows. There is a moment in the finale when you may let out a few tears when Logan, is on the edge he puts in the effort to stay up but it doesn't work. Mangold keeps this on a high, keeping up with the material from the previous two hours. Sure Logan isn't perfect but it is the best Wolverine has ever whet mistakes Mangold made with 2013s The Wolverine he cleared them up here. After nearly seventeen years and 9 X-Men movies (not including Deadpool) either playing as the main character or a cameo Jackman's Wolverine has been through a sh*tload of stories in the X-Men universe and this is no exception to his brutality. It's fair to say Jackman's final time as the Wolverine ends on an emotional high.VERDICT: A bloody brilliant Wolverine movie, it's brutal, action-packed and endlessly exciting, this is the best Wolverine has been in years."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Logan is the third and concluding film in the Wolverine trilogy and the final appearance of Hugh Jackman in the title role. After two mediocre solo films, this one more than makes up for their shortcomings. It is a fitting swansong for both Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart.In the year 2029, an aging Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) lives in a hideout on the Mexican border caring for the elderly Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). To make ends meet, Logan works as a chauffeur around local towns in Texas. One day, a young mutant named Laura (Dafne Keen), who is being pursued by armed forces, suddenly turns up at Logan's residence and he is forced to come out of hiding to protect her at all costs.Dark, violent, and highly emotional, Logan is an appropriate ending to the long lasting Wolverine saga. Hugh Jackman once again gives it his all in the lead role. It's sad to know that this is very likely the last time we'll ever see him play this iconic character, but this film will certainly cement his legacy deep in our minds. Patrick Stewart, who also gives his final performance as Professor Charles Xavier, was great as well. One can't help but feel sad for this once great mind succumbing to the detrimental effects of old age and senility.I rate it a solid 9/10"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Growing up, i was and still is, an X-Men fan since the age of seven through comics. In truth, Wolverine was never a character that I had gravitated to. But I had a sense of sentiment for the character via association to the X-Men.In the year 2000, the first X-Men movie was released on the big screen. Again, Wolverine was never a character that I had any inclination for. But it was through Hugh Jackman's portrayal of him, that the story was told from his perspective about the X-Men.Fast forward 17 years later, this movie is not about the Wolverine, the superhero who seemed immortal, without any weaknesses, that goes on a rampage whenever to save the day by being the best at what he does. No....and i am thankful for that.This movie is about the man named Logan. A character driven piece that hides a superhero beneath it. It is almost like an independent film that explores the flaws and tribulations of who the character is. We get to see his vulnerability and delves into his code of honor & loyalty to those he cares for. The telling of this story brought forth the man behind the superhero. All the cast were great and a special shout-out to Dafne Keen, whom plays Laura very convincingly; amidst beloved characters that had years of history on the big screen.The movie is not without flaws, but it made me care for the story of the man named Logan, whom defines him as the best at what he does.If this really is Hugh Jackman's last run as the character, it is a perfect send off and thank you for playing Logan/Wolverine for all these years."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Been waiting for this movie since long time, and it is worth the wait. Very new perspective of the producers (to see the Wolvie age and lose his ability to heal), and throughout the movie Logan's characters are gradually revealed. At first a little annoying, then the disturbance grows as situations get worse. At some point I really dislike our hero cause he seems to give up on everything (except for his instinct to run , as a wolf) and swears a lot (even to the blood of his own). However, as the actions progress, the deepest of his heart also has been revealed - the love for his family, his friends, and his kind - mutants. Death is the only redemption, and he got his death with dignity, love, and fulfillment. Sad to see the end, but we all believe the Wolverine spirit always live, especially in his daughter Laura (what a cool kid she is, haha)."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "This film has left me completely at a loss. It is so so good, so emotional, intense and brutal. I really want to see it again but I'm not sure I can put myself through it, it has affected me so much. Brilliant acting, superb effects, it will deserve any awards it might be nominated for."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "This is a very, very good, gritty science-fiction road-trip chase movie. Think Terminator 2 or Children of Men, except the child is the opposite of defenseless or helpless.Don't expect a superhero movie - it definitely is not. Super powers are nearly nonexistent. People expecting cheap laughs, explosions, CGI, and the typical \"the good guys will win\" movie (e.g. Avengers) may be disappointed. This is a character drama with occasional bouts of violence that demonstrate the brutal reality of being clawed.This is a movie about aging, mortality, vulnerability, parenting and legacy. It is not a perfect movie, but its a damn good one that has me still thinking about it now, long after the credits ended. Despite a simple plot, there were plot holes and the villains needed more backstory. However, despite the movie running for over two hours I still wanted more. This movie demonstrates how famous comic book characters can be presented in standalone movies, without blatantly setting up a sequel.Lastly, Dafne Keen was excellent. Hopefully her career amounts to more than Edward Furlong's."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "While it is a Marvel movie and a X-Men movie; Logan is very different than the other movies of X-Men and Marvel. It is more like a character based drama that happens to center around characters of Logan and Xavier.If you are planning to go to that movie with the intention of seeing the next Marvel movie with its light heart-ed humor, or next X-Men movie where they don their sleek outfits and mutant-power their way through a world threatening evil; please note that this is not one of those.Movie feels very different in the sense that it takes itself very seriously. No humor that is placed there that is aimed at the invisible audience superhero knows to be there, no action scenes where all the troubles of a beating and conflict is magically wiped away at the next scene. Also no billion dollar cutting edge tech stealth planes and state of the art tech mansions where characters are only concerned about world politics and threats since they somehow all live off some kind of trust fund.Reality of life is in the center of the movie. The struggle of those characters with decaying health, with money struggle, with grief of the past events in a world that does not have a place for them anymore and their conflicting way of looking at what 'future' means. Those are things what this movie is mostly about, and the interactions between Xavior, Laura and Logan.If you always liked Xavior and Wolverine; and wanted to see more of them in a more character focused story; then you will love Logan. But if you are looking for a movie where heroes don their sleek uniform and beat the next bad guy in some flashy action where fight's only purpose is to entertain audience; you might find this movie to be off- putting and depressing."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "This should be the kind of heroes we like to watch! An enticing Finale for Logan :) Can't be Thank enough Marvel to give something like this. Stupendous idea and thought. Can make sense to all the motion pictures lover right there. Great movie here folks, you should watch it Thank you Hugh Jackman."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "If there was any film likely to leave me in tears this year in the cinema, it was going to be Logan. Hugh Jackman's swansong to the X- Men franchise and to the character of Wolverine he'd been playing for 17 years. Logan is a character I've been watching since I was 4 years old back in 2004, so in many ways it felt like the end of my childhood.Thankfully, Logan is a film that has matured with it's audience that had been watching X-Men since their early years. It's a dark, miserable and depressing film and barely resembles a single superhero film of recent years. I'll also say seriously that this is the best superhero film since The Dark Knight, possibly even better.This was a beautiful, powerful and violent send-off that worked far better than I ever possibly could have imagined. Hugh Jackman plays a far older, broken and worn down Wolverine whose healing powers don't work very well anymore and has to look after a dementia stricken Professor Xavier who is prone to dangerous psychological outbursts. Logan ends up reluctantly having to look after and take a clone of himself in the form of a young girl to sanctuary while being hunted by a military group.Where Logan differs itself from other superhero films is its tone and content. While Deadpool was a violent and crude film, Logan is far more mature, resonate and powerful. This is not a kids film, not just due to the adult content, but the bleak and miserable tone throughout.It's really sad to see these characters you grew up with in such a broken state. Logan is a borderline alcoholic reduced to being a limo driver, while Xavier is a shadow of his former self. It's heartbreaking stuff that works so well thanks to the incredible performances from Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. They manage to mix superhero nonsense with genuine heart, warmth, tragedy and even comedy at times. It's all so bittersweet, but it works.They're joined by a star making turn from Dafne Keen as 'Laura' a near mute clone of Logan who is on the run from a military group. While barely saying anything, Keen brings so much to the role, delivering a really touching father-daughter relationship Logan had been unable to have throughout his whole tragic life. What's even more impressive is the fact this is only Keen's second role in her entire career and she nearly stole the show from Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. This is probably the best child performance I've seen since Chloe Grace Moretz in Kick-Ass.The Office/Extras writer Stephen Merchant also gave a memorable turn as Caliban, a pale albino mutant who brings a lighter tone to some of Logan's more bleak outlook. He's essentially doing what he usually does, but with some makeup on. Anyway, it was nice to see him a huge blockbuster film for once. He earns it more than his co- writer Ricky Gervais. And now I just imagined an alternate universe where Gervais was in this too...James Mangold takes on directorial duties as he did with the previous Wolverine outing 'The Wolverine' in 2013, which was great until it's third act, but still 1000x better than 2009's 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'. Logan thankfully does not suffer from the same pitfalls as Mangold's last effort with the Wolverine character. Probably due to the fact he was allowed creative control to make a violent, R- rated send-off that lacks a bombastic CGI heavy finale.All the action in Logan feels small and contained, but is brutal and hard-hitting at the same time. It was so satisfying to see Wolverine actually cut people up into gory messes. While extremely violent, it all works within the tone of the film. I wasn't a massive fan of the frequent swearing at the beginning of the film, but that soon wore off and they toned it down.Mangold directs the action scenes with kinetic beauty, making use of both Wolverine and Laura in some visually beautiful action scenes. The cinematography of Logan feels closer to No Country for Old Men than it does a superhero film. Logan has the vibe of a neo-western and looks gorgeous, full of nice looking deserts and even a trip to Las Vegas.Without spoiling anything, I'd honestly be okay if this was the ending to the X-Men series as a whole. It leaves things in such a powerful and perfect way that I was tearing up. While is the end of Hugh Jackman's run as Wolverine, it also feels like the end point of the X-Men we all grew up with, and it managed to do it all perfectly.Logan is a powerful, violent and beautiful send-off for Hugh Jackman's 17 year run as Logan. It's also one of the best superhero films of all-time and likely to be one of the best films of 2017. I really hope there's Oscar considerations for Logan for next years awards."}]
