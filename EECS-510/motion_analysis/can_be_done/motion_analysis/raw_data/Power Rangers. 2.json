I went into the theater not expecting much from this movie but I was wrong, it was a good movie. Not great or OK it was simply good. It had great CGI and the acting was good for a young cast. I loved the first 2 acts of the movie they were really strong and had good story telling. But act 3 in my opinion seemed silly and sort of rushed. The first 2 acts were great because of 2 things. Great characters and a steady pace. The character development was great and I liked how the writers really stuck to making them interesting so that the audience would care about them, especially RJ Cylers character. Nothing was rushed and was going at a great pace and then all of a sudden act 3 came into play and it turned into a mediocre action film and wasn't very exciting and I believe that is due to the villain. I was not a fan. Her motives are too over used and simply a lame character. The actress was fine but the character it'self wasn't anything special and made the action scenes dull. Other than that the kids will love it and if you are a power ranger fan I think you will be pleased. It's fun for the whole family."}, {"score": "2/10", "review": "I was a fan of the show in the nineties; I found it extremely entertaining because of its simplicity and goofiness. I enjoyed the 1995 film for the same reasons, and the likability of the cast. So, I wanted this movie to, at least, be entertaining. It was not. The characters were bland, uninteresting, and unlikable. The costumes, so to speak, looking terrible, and exactly what you'd expect from people attempting to update a campy 90's show. There wasn't a single character to whom people could relate in the whole movie. If anything, the experience was exhausting and infuriating. Picture the Transformers movie with WORSE effects and even less likable characters. Do yourself a favor; do no go see this bland, useless nonsense."}, {"score": "4/10", "review": "You know Hollywood is running out of ideas when a hallmark TV series is made into a big screen production, and then recycled and redecorated with a bigger budget for a new generation. That's perfectly acceptable with franchises like the Jurassic Park films, where sequels are released every decade or so and aimed at a specific cluster of the audience. Power Rangers, on the other hand, has no idea who its target audience is and here's probably why: a suit from Lionsgate (yes, Lionsgate) green- lit the reboot even as the TV series is still being aired, hired screenwriters who wrote superhero films like X-Men: First Class and producers from the Transformers franchise, then hired unknown actors and a newbie director before ending up with a PG-13 fiasco that's neither here nor there. At just over 120 minutes, it's highly unlikely this film will grab and hold the attention of children, whereas anyone over 40 expecting a glorious heist or scandalous bachelor party is in for the wrong film. This leaves us with older teens widely known as the YA crowd (young adults). Now here's the caveat: Back in the early '90s, superheroes films were limited to one-off appearances a year. 25 years later and there are no less than five superhero films a year (this year we have six including one animation) from stalwart studios with an ever increasing budget and fan base. Yet as a superhero origins film, the new Power Rangers film simply doesn't stack up to the expectations of the general audience, let alone teenagers who expect nothing but cutting edge effects in a mega bucks franchise. So while lacking a target audience, the bigger question is why a reboot after more than 20 years? Cashing in on the current superhero culture seems like an obvious motive, but the disparity in production quality is even more obvious from the opening scene right through to the end. Except for some campy moments from Elizabeth Banks as a gold digging alien witch (How's Rita Repulsa for camp?) there is no other character worth caring about, not even the titular high school misfits who discover extraordinary abilities but are too dumb to figure out their purpose as a team of intergalactic warriors. Sadly, Power Rangers turns out to be a cinematic misfire that should have gone straight to TV. But even then, titles from Netflix and Amazon Studios far outweigh this debacle whose only purpose appears to be a disappearing act in your wallet."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Loved it!

I've only caught a few episodes of Power Rangers here and there over the years, found it campy, predictable fun, but wasn't really a fan. I write this so you know where this opinion comes from. So after a promising start in the distant past and some high-school hi-jinks with a bunch of misfits/rejects, something strange started happening. As more and more fantastical elements were introduced, the more I felt underwhelmed and doubtful. Not quite sure when it started, but it was particularly obvious with the introduction of the Zorgs (robot-dinosaur vehicles) that was very lacklustre. The Zorg designs might have been too \"detailed\", but I even had trouble making out what dinosaur they were supposed to be. To be fair, I love the new Ranger outfits although, once again, their first appearance was kind of muffed.The plot that seemed not so bad at first with actual character building got stupid and corny pretty fast with dumb decisions from both the heroes (yes, let's all jump) and the lame main villain (let's end all life on Earth with me on it, because, uh...). The actors certainly tried hard, were probably better than standard TV actors, but they didn't sell the touching or dramatic scenes to me. Then again, I also blame the script. However, the highlight acting-wise was the young black man called RJ Cyler in an autistic role (despite too much makeup). But beyond the plot and acting, kind of secondary in that type of film, there should have been a building sense of wonder and excitement that wasn't really there for me. The visual effects were hit (Zordon on the wall) and miss (the Zorgs). The fights that should have been thrilling seemed mostly unexciting and uninspired to me, especially the last one. So without the nostalgia factor in its favour, this big-budget remake didn't make a Power Rangers fan out of me.Rating: 3.5 out of 10 (mediocre)P.S. A really obnoxious product placement actually got some of the few good laughs."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "Join five teenagers as they embark on overly complex origin story, staggering change in directional tone, intense product placement and awkward usage of nostalgia. The hectic mess is not without its charm, the team is, at the very least, likable with more personality than transforming robot movies in recent time had, though it's not a high achievement. The best thing one could say about this reboot is it could've been so much worse.Origin story isn't the most novel idea, but it has become a necessity as of late, especially for a reboot. The Rangers undergo a series of exposition, mainly taking serious direction from other superhero themed movie Chronicle, but also translating the corny style from its original television show. It tells both the story of apocalypse and also abundance of jokes, and then it veers into the realm of heavy personal issues.The sudden shift is felt so many times that the movie feels like a robot piloted by several people. However, it's not without charm or humor. The cast might feel bizarrely put together at fight, but they do have their moments. This provides a little bit of bravado and less vanilla than the original show. If anything, they are limited only by the fantasy troupes which may seem predictable or campy, then again this is Power Rangers, not Logan.It has one edge over other superhero movies; the product placement. The trend has been done for years, but Power Rangers take it to the next level. For action, humanoid and robotic, it mostly stays true to the original source, including poses and jingles. This does feel like an afternoon show with the ad and spark of nostalgia.Many have complained that superhero movies are too gritty or too corny, Power Rangers is both, often at the same time. This is clearly not an advantage as it would have fared much better sticking to the light humor or heavy personal struggle. Still, for a movie based on 90s children show, it offers mild indulgent and barely avoids being a total disaster."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Naomi Scott or Kim in the movie was just amazing!Some scenes didn't make sense like why these kids were bullied when some of them were good enough to be bullies xD.

Although some scenes were cringy (no spoilers) and the monsters could've been different (like the gold one) and more presentable, it was still good to see.... now i don't know if the monsters were like that originally (cause, not a fanboy) but the main villain could've fought better for someone who took down tougher rangers.

It has nothing to do the original ones. The Power Rangers have been around now for a long time and only 2 of their movies have made it to the big screen \"Mighty Morphin Rangers Movie\" and \"A Turbo Rangers Movie.\" This is the third Power Rangers movie brought to the Screen. Also being a PG-13 Rated movie really says a lot. It's obvious to expect a bit more full on action and violence.First of all the acting was not that great. But that's not too surprising as the Power Rangers series and movies were never about great acting. Elizabeth Banks and the voices of Bill Hader and Bryan Cranston really did steal the entire show. While it didn't save the film they were definitely the highlights. The CGI was pretty bad. We both imagine that some scenes would look great in 3-D, a lot of it involving slow motion and car crashes. But the CGI was not really an update to the year 2017. it's obvious they were trying to also keep it like the good old Fox Kids days, but it it looked like it was trying to look good at the same time.If you really are looking to spend a weekend out with your family or grew up watching and loving the Power Rangers there is a chance you may feel like a good kid again, but all in all while the movie did have its moments of good it just really isn't worth seeing in the cinema. Maybe try renting it on Netflix when it's out. That's not to say other people will love it and enjoy it. We're sure others will adore this film, but for us it didn't quite hit the mark.

Jay And Nick- The Autistic Reviewers."}, {"score": "4/10", "review": "The new Power Rangers film features very little morphin' and is not exactly mighty.I should mention that the \"original\" (virtually all of the action sequences were actually stock footage from the Japanese Super Sentai) Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers was my favourite show between the ages of two and five. Believe it or not, though, I actually haven't watched this children's show in many years, so I can't really speak as to the film's loyalty to the source material.What I can say is that liberties have been taken with the characters' backstories, but the main personal attributes seem to be intact, and I had no problem with the changes. Trini (the yellow ranger) is gay, now, and Billy is \"on the spectrum\", but these changes merely gave depth to characters who really only existed as obvious stereotypes in the original series, and I liked that.I have to say that I did find it quite amusing that they make a big deal out of announcing every single character's full name in the final scene, but omit Trini's surname. Billy's mother calls out all of the other rangers' full names, and ends with \"and Trini!\" I can only assume that it's because in the show, her last name was Kwan, and the new actress, Becky G, is of Mexican descent. Just call her Kwan or give her a different name, good lord. Even funnier, in the end- credits every single actor playing a ranger's parent is credited with their character's name, except Trini's parents, who are credited as \"Trini's Dad\" and \"Trini's Mom\".The film stars the aforementioned Becky G, as well as her four team-mates played by Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, and Ludi Lin. I assumed all five were American (only two are), so flawless were their accents. They all deliver solid performances, with Montgomery and Cyler the only ones required by the screenplay to do any real acting. Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Banks join the cast as the team's mentor and antagonist, respectively. Both are great, obviously, though seem to think themselves in an entirely different film than the main five. The tone of these two characters, both in dialogue and delivery, clashes crazily against the other five. It was probably intentional, but it was weird. There are certain extreme moments of melodrama sandwiched between scenes of cheesiness that just feel out-of-place, too.So in the movie the five teenagers with attitude (sadly, or perhaps thankfully, they are not referred to as such in the film) come across a mysterious rock and a strange cave, waking up the next morning with superpowers. They reunite and try to work out what's going on while familiarising themselves with their new abilities. If this sounds familiar, that's because it's basically the plot of Chronicle. Funnily enough, the writer of that film, Max Landis, was actually at one point attached to this movie, but is no longer credited. Weird.Five writers (count them), however, are credited. As often happens with films with a large number of writers, the script feels somewhat off. We begin with a coincidence that feels more lazy than anything; at the exact moment the five obtain their new powers, the antagonist's \"dead\" body is accidentally caught in a fishing net. For an even worse coincidence within a coincidence, the captain of that boat happens to be the father of one of the rangers. Of course.It's director Dean Israelite's second film, and I don't think his direction left much to be desired. His first film was Project Almanac, and I preferred Power Rangers over that one, The score is solid, the soundtrack pretty hit-and-miss. The editing is a little disappointing at times; we only see the rangers morph once, and it's not a very comprehensive look that we get. Also, Jason appears to pull a sword from nowhere and then we get a scene of him returning it to the space-ship later. Not sure what happened there. The action's decent, but we only get to it in the final twenty minutes of the film, and I mean that literally. There's no end-of-act-1 skirmish; the bad guys simply attack at the end of the movie.One other thing I find mildly irritating was the rangers' helmets retracting around their faces whenever they spoke. I guess the intentional might've been to make them feel more like relatable people and less like faceless drones, but it just came across as a lazy way to give the actors more face-time \u2013 which is silly, because, as I said, they only morph the one time. We've seen their faces plenty.The red ranger drives a red Ford Ranger, that was kind of cute. Certainly more subtle than when that same ranger hurls a Camaro at a bad guy and yells \"sorry, Bumblebee!\". Man, that moment was a funny little jab at the Transformers franchise; why'd you have to go and ruin it by playing Captain Obvious? The first song over the credits is the same as in the original film from 1995, so that was a nice reference, but I think I would've preferred the opening theme to the television show. That theme only plays once in the whole film, and is horribly misused. It only plays for a few seconds, and only the main chorus. Where's the build up!?

They are outcasts in their school and society until they stumble upon these power coins and a spaceship and its there that they learn they are a new generation of Power Rangers.I was born in 1994 and was quite familiar with the Power Rangers when I was a kid. Whenever they were on TV, these were the superheroes my brother and I looked up to. Watching the god-awful but somehow hilariously bad \"Might Morphin Power Rangers\" movie from 1997 where every time they kick a monster into a wall it explodes into purple goo (no joke) from a very young age somehow told me that I wanted to be a Power Ranger. then I grew up, the Power Rangers weren't popular anymore, and now I am in college.Enter 2017, where studios try to make everything a \"thing\" now, and that is the case with this movie. I had a slimmer of hope that this movie would be good. And if it wasn't good, I was hoping it would at least be enjoyable in that fun, cheesy, goofy, entertaining type way that the show was back in the 90s.I'm not gonna lie: for the first two-thirds of this movie, I found what I was watching fairly enjoyable. Was it ground-breaking? No. It seemed like they were going to finally get a Power Rangers movie right for the first time. I was supporting these characters the whole way. There's a scene in the middle of the movie where they have a heart-to-heart with one another, and that scene actually provided some nice character depth and backstory for those characters whose backstory was completely glossed over at the beginning of the film. All of the actors playing the Power Rangers were also really good. Naomi Scott, RJ Cyler, Dacre Montgomery, Becky G, and Ludi Line. all five of them did a good job in their roles. The movie really hinged on them and if they ended up sucking, this movie would have been a complete failure.Elizabeth Banks was just a cartoon copy of herself. She was so over the top in such a serious movie that both her plan and her character became stupid after awhile. She was a definition of a clich\u00e9 villain, showing up only to pose a threat and not really do much and then be at the center of the final throw down. Bryan Cranston as Zordon... pretty good actually.Aside from Elizabeth Banks, everything leading up to the climatic showdown was actually pretty enjoyable. Watching the Power Rangers train was actually pretty cool, and seeing them stumble upon their Zords for the first time was quite the site. But then the third act happened, and it completely derailed the movie. Everything leading up to the point at the beginning of the third act where a Krispy Kreme Doughnuts became a plot device was fairly good. Once this plot device is introduced, that and everything after it is a complete waste of time. It's all bad. There's nothing good about the third act of this movie. Sure you have the Power Rangers kicking ass, that's what we all wanted to see, but it looked really sloppy. This movie fell into the habit of having its action scenes filmed in what I like to call \"Slow-Fast-Mo,\" which is a style that was cool ten years ago for one movie then everyone started doing it and it began to suck. Things in this third act happen that don't make any sense. How are they flying their Zords if they haven't flown them before? The special effects are really terrible. The CGI looked like it came from a Playstation 2 game's cut scenes, and of course there's a giant monster....that they have to fight...and it's gold... and gigantic. There was nothing exciting about this fight. I didn't care about this small town and whether or not it got destroyed. It's in the middle of frigging nowhere. It's strange to think that this movie is fairly enjoyable for the first two acts and makes you believe that you are watching a good movie. Once that third act pops up though, it really just becomes what the TV show was. Bad. But unlike the TV show and the 1997 movie, this was bad in bad way.I am going to give \"Power Rangers\" a 4.2/10.Check out my video review of \"Power Rangers\" here: https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=ckFQeFdsIv0&t=25s"}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "I remember watching the premiere back when I was six years old, and... I thought it was idiotic. The original show was always to goofy for me, even as a little boy. But I had nothing to do and I had some movie passes so I decided to check it out. It's actually pretty good. A lot of critics are going into this expecting to hate it and their reviews reflect that. In the reviews I've read or seen, I keep hearing things like \"Well its not as stupid as it could have been\" or \"Some of it wasn't so terrible\" or other equally back handed compliments. The reality is, the Power Rangers is an inherently silly idea. But once you get past that, this is a pretty fun movie. You know the drill, five kids get together in Angel Grove, a much grittier Angel Grove than I remember. They get their hands on some power coins, Rita Repulsa shows up and some over the top action ensues. So yes, it is just a bigger version of what we saw on the show, but still effective. It takes itself more seriously than the show did and it is much darker. But it doesn't go to far, it still feels close to the original and it does have its lighter moments. Its biggest strength though was the chemistry between the leads. The five kids really worked well with each other. And they did spend time developing each of them. They definitely worked well as a team. And Elizabeth Banks killed it as Rita. I've heard some reviewers complain that she was to over the top, but no way. Rita is supposed to be over the top. You can tell Banks was having a lot of fun. She had a particularly brutal scene with the Trini the Yellow Ranger. And needles to say, the climax was awesome. The new Zords, the new costumes, they looked great. If I had one complaint, and it is a bit odd, the two girls are a little to similar. The three boys are all distinct. But the two girls, they even look way to much alike. Once the costume are on, then it's easy to tell. And if your a big fan of the series, pay attention, there are a few references here and there."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Power Rangers succeeds as a film that actually cares about character building, unlike the typical Transformers movie that throws you right in the middle of numbing explosions and special effects, or getting too caught up in it's lore. It is never easy to make a character driven movie for an ensemble cast, but director Dean Israelite chose to gamble a majority of the runtime on fleshing out the characters, and it pays off. We are in turn rewarded with an effective, even if somewhat flawed storyline that warms us up to the heroes and allows us to establish an emotional connection with them, from their struggles to their triumph. And the film's climax, non-stop action backed with great music, becomes a hugely rewarding payoff.Israelite, a professed fan of the series, really does get it. He uses reliable tropes of a coming of age, underdog story, and litters the film with the right amount of nostalgia and cheesiness, in all the right places. The film is ultimately funny, nostalgic and uplifting, even if predictable. Fans of the series, watch it with your friends and go in expecting nothing.

The build-up and introduction of the first few characters was very well paced and I started to become more interested in the movie, even if it was a generic \"outcast is special\" scenario. Unfortunately, just as I was starting to gain interest, the film started to lose its speed. As I mentioned before, the first few rangers introduced were done very well, and I even felt a bit invested in these characters. The remaining rangers, however, seemed to be awkwardly shoved into the plot. With little to no background given other then that they just happened to be in the right place at the right time with the other characters. The acting was also not that great in some areas either. Especially Dacre Montgomery as the Red ranger. Don't get me wrong, he wasn't a horrible pick for the leading ranger, he just could have done better in some moments. You can definitely pick out the times when the acting was very poor. Another thing to note is that the pacing felt off at times. The first half was set up very nicely, with good introduction to the world we were being introduced too, but what the film does wrong after that is it takes the audience's new knowledge of this world and shoves the climax of the film in our face. One second the protagonists are on their knees clearly defeated with no real answer on how to win, and then, in what feels like less than a minute or two, they're an unstoppable force that no one can defeat. My friends and I were laughing the entire duration of the climax, it was just so ridiculous and off paced we couldn't help it. Overall, not the greatest movie. I could go more in depth about the action and antagonist but that just reaffirms what I already said. I will admit that the film it had its good and funny moments, especially the first half. Go see it if you've got nothing else to do and want to laugh at some corny jokes.

It does not hurt that the closest thing to bad press I heard about the movie was that they needed to push back the filming, which only allowed them to add the star power of Bryan Cranston and Elisabeth banks.Only indifference I had towards the movie was that as corny as the TV show was the concept of a group of overachieving teenagers being selected to become the best of the best makes sense (Especially because they are teenagers, they should be the best of the best at lease). Because dark is cool these days, the Rangers needed to have more edge to them, which is why this new team is made of \"diamonds in the rough\" who society has scrub off as screw-ups. So the idea is that Bryan Cranston who plays the big giant head Zordon, has the power coins pick those who have the potential to be the best of the best.Out of all the superhero movies that are coming out, Power Rangers is not the best of the best, it's definitely a diamond in the rough that has potential, but still needs more training. I did like the cast of teenagers who had some very distinctive personalities, as they try to even out the characters. I did love the fact that the Blue Ranger was played by a black dude, and The Black Ranger was played by an Asian dude (it's less distracting than what happen in the TV show).Bryan Cranston's star power did nothing to make his Zordon a better giant head, but Elisabeth Banks was great as Rita Repulsa. In a time with Superhero movies having weak antagonist, I got to say, I enjoyed what Banks did with the character and loved to see her on the screen.So I went into this really wanting to see this and I was not disappointed.

It IS a Power Rangers film so if you're familiar at all with the source material you know to expect a little cheese. The liberal Hollywood crap is kept to a minimum (a character is made gay but this doesn't impact the story at all, so one can assume it's done only to put butts in the seats and not actually do anything meaningful or different with the character). There's a few instances of meta-humor which I'm a sucker for and I always enjoy (one such joke is in the previews). The action is exciting and the effects are top- notch, although I question some of the choices, namely the idea to turn Zordon into some kind of giant pin art toy. I felt longing for the giant head in the tube. Anyway, it's an entertaining film. If you're into pseudo-artistic Cannes Festival stuff, stay away from this film.

While following the hype train, I was happy to see that the film was being taken seriously. The only aspect I really disliked from all the announcements that were being made were the Power Ranger outfits themselves. Aside from that, everything else was pretty much on point. Power Rangers isn't the disaster I was hoping it wasn't going to be. For the original fans out there, this movie just was not going to work with that campy tone similar to the television series. It worked for what it was as a television show for children such as myself back in the day. That just wasn't going to translate well on the big screen, lets not kid ourselves. Plus the previous Power Ranger films that came out in the 90's weren't met with acclaim or did big numbers at the box office. The film's main problem is that it has an identity crisis, trying to be serious teen drama to an adventure filled sci-fi action film. Moments work here and there, sporadically. RJ Cyler is the bright spot as Billy the Blue Ranger. He's the only one that really gives the group of teens a lot flare, and his autistic side is portrayed with respect. Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, Ludi Lin, and Becky G are all given something to do. Montgomery's Jason is the once promising athlete turned screw-up and the team's leader. He almost finds redemption in the film given his responsibilities as the Red Ranger. Scott's Kimberly finds a new home when she's kicked out of her own click in school. Lin's Zack is an outcast who acts tough, but that's just to hide his fears and insecurities. Becky G's Trini is also an outcast loner who comes to accept herself, her coming out is handled with care and treated with respect like Billy's autism. The cast actually is not too bad either and for the most part deliver with their performances. The film tries to give them all layers and it can be engaging, even if it is a Breakfast Club ripoff.Bryan Cranston and Bill Hader are great. Even as a child, I've hated Alpha-5 since the original show premiered and here he's a little less annoying thanks to Hader's performance. Cranston's Zordon has more to do that tell the Rangers who their up against. He's got personality and also has ulterior motives. The weak link is Elizabeth Banks as Rita. She looks like she's having fun and cutting it loose to portray her, but she doesn't do much outside of conquering the world like all typical villains do. We don't really learn anything about her and why she's doing what she's doing. More screen time to develop her would have been nice. At best the film plays out like an episode of any DC/Marvel superhero show on the CW or abc. The origin story is exactly what anyone would expect in an origin story. It can be tiring to sit through as the familiar tropes are extremely apparent and can get boring from time to time. Once it goes into high gear it gets fun. This is where the identity crisis also comes in play as it becomes a CGI, over the top action feast for 15-20 minutes. Despite it being fun to watch, it really never felt completely earned, the story never really positioned itself to actually feel earned. Also bare in mind there is a lot of Krispy Kreme promotion in the film. I've never seen a movie put that much promotion and devotion at all to any product. Being a former Power Ranger die-hard, I cannot watch a single frame of any Power Ranger episodes at all, they're all so terrible, but the nostalgia always stays. For a reimagining/homage it's a step towards the right direction. But it's also a jumbled mess. Should there be a sequel, I would hope it figures out what it wants to be. Also redesign the damn outfits they're an eyesore. Less is more. All in all I'm happy that the filmmakers took the property seriously and I'm open to see what's next. 6.8/10"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "A morphenomenal reimaging of a classic franchise. A crossblend of Chronicle meets The Breakfast Club but surprisingly it works! The character development was a real surprise since in the original Power Rangers series, that didn't exactly exist. There's a good blend of cheesiness that fans that watched MMPR grew up with as well as solid storytelling to make for a great time. If you go into this expecting for a purist Xerox of what you watched growing up, you'll be disappointed. But if you go into this with an open mind looking to have a fun time, you won't be disappointed. I was very impressed with the overall performances of the entire cast especially Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa and RJ Cyler as Billy. Fans of the franchise and even those who didn't bother to care for it before should watch this. It's a very fun film that makes you feel like a kid again. As they said in the 90s, It's Morphing Time"}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "It's hard to screw up the Power Rangers when the original series embraced its campy origins in Super Sentai. This film takes itself as both a serious reboot with a lot of underlying cheesiness. Some welcome inclusions widen the Power Rangers typical story line of acceptance to relevant themes in our current generation. The first act starts off really strong, seeing a darker-tone set up our cast of heroes. The second act starts to dwindle off and waste time before finally revealing each heroes' backstory and making them bond together. The third act is (unfortunately) rushed but still an entertaining and satisfying final fight. If only the film shortened the second act and lengthened the third would it have solidified its existence as a strong film. Sadly its flaws detract from it becoming a relevant movie in the year 2017, but it will make history with the first gay superhero and the (first?) autistic superhero as well. As a Power Rangers entry though, oh boy, is it exciting. Far better than the other Ranger's entries into film. Sadly, the one crucial element to nostalgia \u2014 the theme song \u2014 is clipped to FIVE seconds in length. If it had been spread throughout the final fight it could have fully embraced its origins."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "Guess its time to whip out your old Tamagotchi and listen to whatever Marcy Playground song you've recorded on your Tiger Talkboy when you were six; because the nineties are back! Don't believe me, just check out the newest blockbuster film that's about to hit your multiplex with the force of a speeding Bronco. Yes the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers are back and this time instead of importing stock footage from some cheap Japanese superhero show, this brooding, edgier version is importing clich\u00e9s from every American superhero film from the last fifteen years.Just how much edgier is this new movie? Well the story begins with three of the five soon-to-be Rangers spending their Saturdays in detention so already they're more irascible than Bulk and Skull. They're also about half as much fun as evidenced after our five teenagers with attitude meet up, discover their multi-colored power coins and proceed to stare at each other in confusion. This lasts an entire act and throughout we're only given the archetypal outlines of our heroes to play with. There's the bland Red leader (Montgomery), the Yellow outsider (G.), the Black bad boy (Lin) and the Pink Ranger (Scott) who seems to think cutting her hair on a whim doesn't make her the personification of mayonnaise.Then of course there's Billy (Cyler), the Blue Ranger. He's on the spectrum; you can tell because he outright says he's \"on the spectrum.\" While this could have been a good moment to truly act upon the TV show's (1993-1995) phoned-in anti-bully, inclusion-based \"the more you know,\" pablum, the movie basically just uses him as a narrative building block. That's of course when they're not also using the Blue Ranger as a tonally embarrassing point of mirth for the sake of undermining the gritty tone. Considering that his autism is boiled down to a running joke, its a miracle RJ Cyler comes across as sincere as he does. Every time the ensemble tries to elevate him as the movie's heartfelt center, you really want to believe it's sincerity, even if it feels counterfeit.Its that faux sincerity and the nostalgia that will no doubt sell long-time fans on this new film. As much as the reboot wobbles between seriousness and silliness, the fact that there is an appearance of a center of mass, means that there's just enough here for audiences to trick themselves into thinking they saw the best version they possibly could have made. It makes a kind of sense; how can you really make a realistic movie about children gaining superpowers through alien technology to fight evil? While I don't agree with the premise of the question (I mean, does it really need to be realistic?), I also don't think the answer is to wait until the very end to introduce the franchises sillier minutia. Especially when the directing and editing would make anyone with eyeballs want to spin them back into their head. It's not Fantastic Four (2014)-level bad, but the fact that I'm bringing up that film in the same breath as this one, is evidence their both are in the same ball park and both need to answer for the millions of dollars wasted. I mean come on, the best part about this mess is the slovenly fight choreography which could have been done with a couple of costumes and a million yen.It's hard to say Power Rangers (sponsored by Krispy Kreme) is the latest victim in franchise co-oping by greedy executives, short-sighted PR experts and story-arcs by committee. While Spider-Man fans and Batman fans could argue their IP's came from some nebulous notion of artistry over commerce, Power Rangers has been a cheaply cobbled cash grab pretty much from inception. In that regard the fact that this film has any semblance of sincerity is a minor miracle. If you got to see it, focus on that and that alone. Go, go mediocrity."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "High on the heels of frantic superhero revivals of past, Lionsgate acquired another niche property of the 90's in hopes of launching another multi-million dollar franchise. Luckily enough for me, being a long time hardcore fan, Power Rangers was the chosen product. I realise the cynicism of my over excitement for this film and my overwhelming praise for it, being a detractor of the Marvel cinematic universe, but subjectivism and personal nostalgia end up playing a big part in relating to these films, so... tough luck.Power Rangers is not and was never a franchise for everyone. Its sole selling point was a very childish one, that you either related to or not. The story lines and plots were recycled, thin and repetitive and it's very cheesy and campy nature was never shed under a rug; it was always thrown directly into our faces. Nevertheless, the \"narrative\" potential of the series was hinted on some occasions and was only sporadically developed either because budget constraints held it back or because it never HAD to.What Dean Israelite did here was nevertheless smart, sensible and necessary: adapting the property into the 21st century, focusing and developing characters (that were never), taking creating liberties that were harmless and present us a full-fledged nostalgia punch, armed with heart, humour and excitement. The same as the original series, the film knows it's cheesy. It knows the premise is far-fetched. But the source material asks that of you; and the reason why we escape to movies (these genre specifically) is not to find some way to fit the story into our world. It is to find escapism, fun and entertainment - and this Power Rangers (film) delivers just that and then some. Power Rangers is not a perfect film. It will not please everyone, it will (sadly) not gross obscene amounts of money to launch the very optimistic plans for multiple sequels; but today I woke up with a wide grin knowing that this property was adapted and honoured so well despite its shortcomings, so sensibly to its publicised characters backgrounds and, most importantly, so respectfully to its legacy and fanbase."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "Power Rangers struggles for two major reasons: The movie takes too long to find its feet, and it tries a little too hard to include embarrassing levels of teenage angst. It is understandable that after being renewed for FIVE sequels - that some background set-up is required, and trying to establish character background would be important (although this film falls far short of making the characters have any emotional pull).When the movie finally gets rolling - that is when fans of the franchise can sit back, and really enjoy the show. For those who are seeing this movie as long-time fans of the Rangers - get ready for the nostalgia trip of your life. As a fan of the series, I left this movie satisfied and smiling after the final forty five minutes of pure enjoyment. If you are willing to look passed some of the very apparent flaws of this film, it is overall a very enjoyable experience."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "As a hardcore fan of the original franchise, I was expecting some teen-emo-c**p movie, and wasn't giving it a chance. After seeing it, my mind was blown away! One of the best films I've seen in decades! On few occasions didn't know what's the next thing that is going to happen, and what later happened was spot on! When I went out, I was expecting some real s**t to happen in the city, didn't felt that for a while. Really left me with fantastic impression. I'm 28 and I want to be a Power Ranger again! GO GO POWER RANGERS!"}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Anyone (not just kids) will tell you that part of the 1990s couldn't be understood without looking at one of the biggest phenomenons that debuted at the time, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. I'm aware that the show is still on TV, though it's been a long time since I watched it. As a kid of the 90s, I can say that I liked watching it and even held a Power Rangers birthday party when I was in the second grade. Unlike Disney or the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Power Rangers were something of a fad that I kept in my heart for about three years before I moved on.For those that don't know, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came from Japanese show called Super Sentai. While all the scenes featuring the rangers fighting monsters, puttys and Rita Repulsa came from Japan ala stock footage, the American footage was new and featured new teenagers becoming the rangers to stop evil. I gave the show another watch recently and discovered that it was way cheesier then I remembered. However, there is a fascination with just how cheesy it was and I had fun exploring it. Like a lot of recent super hero movies, our teenage heroes get their turn for a gritty reboot in Power Rangers. In the Northern California town of Angel Grove, young Jason Scott (played by Dacre Montgomery) ruins his football career after a prank gets him arrested. While in detention, he ends up befriending autistic Billy Cranston (played by RJ Miller) and popular girl Kimberly Hart (played by Naomi Scott). The three end up at a rock quarry where Billy is working on uncovering a mysterious object while the too-cool-for-school punk Zack (played by Ludi Lin) and quiet loner Trini (played by Becky G) happen to be at the same time. The objects are rock-like coins that change their lives forever. All five teenagers wake up the next morning to see that their stronger and more resistant to pain. They agree to go back to the site to look for answers. There they find a space ship that has been hidden for millions of years. Awaiting them is Zodon (played by Brian Cranston), a former ranger who seems to be a part of the ships power grid, and Alpha 5 (played by Bill Hader). The kids are told that the coins chose them to become the new rangers. They have to adapt to their new powers soon to stop the recently awoken witch Ritia Repulsa (played by Elizabeth Banks).I have to give Power Rangers a lot of credit for attempting to take a lot of the ridiculous concepts for the show and trying to make them more grounded. The results are mixed, even though overall I had fun. The best thing about this movie was something that the show lacked; the chemistry and emotion from the five teenagers. Not only are all five good actors, but the movie takes a lot of time getting to know them and just how they came to form their team.Even Brian Cranston and Bill Hader do well in adapting their characters to the big screen. One of the weaker performances is Elizabeth Banks. While everyone seems to be playing their parts seriously, she made her character very campy. While she can be fun to watch, it can come off as inconsistent.Speaking of which, the overall tone seems to mix fine until the end. You'll be surprised to learn that out heroes don't morph until way later. Once they do, the movie seems to have trouble sticking to it's gritty origin, especially when the zords start to fight the larger monsters. It's not as impressive as Pacific Rim, but it's better shot then the remake of Godzilla. I'd say the movie is stronger when the characters don't morph.I'll give this seven red ranger helmets out of ten. I'm surprised how much care went into the script\u0085before the characters become the Power Rangers. It seems that the movies really wants to emulate The Breakfast Club more then it does the TV show is based off of. If you didn't like the show, your probably not going to like the movie. It'll probably satisfy former fans like myself and those that want some sci-fi action. I'd say of your even a little curious, then go go see this movie."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "When this movie got announced, I was immediately excited. I hadn't watched Power Rangers since I was maybe 10 years old. I still remember coming downstairs on a Sunday morning to watch it. The original movie also sticks in my mind as one of my favourites in my youth. This movie had a lot riding on it, considering so many people like myself would watch this purely for nostalgia's sake.The movie starts in typical Power Rangers style: with some action in a jokey style. As the plot progresses you begin to meet characters who you know will become Power Rangers. They are introduced well and are given a fairly decent backstory, most of which you learn as the movie progresses. I felt as though I knew a little about each of the Rangers before they morphed, although most of it was somewhat of a clich\u00e9.I thoroughly enjoyed the training segments, along with the introduction of alpha-5 and Zordon. It really took me back to my childhood, but with a modern spin that I felt was not too drastically different from the original. The villain in this movie was creepy though. Far creepier than she was in the original. I can see why this film was given a slightly more mature rating, because I can see how it would not be suitable for younger children. In this sense, I am slightly annoyed as Power Rangers is in essence a children's thing. By giving it a more mature slant to appeal to the masses, you are depriving the true target audience. But that is just my opinion. It is only in the last 45 minutes where the true action begins and we see our characters morph for the first time. The new suits look awesome and I was impressed with the fighting sequences. When the Zords came into play I actually got goosebumps. The \"Go Go Power Rangers\" song playing the background may have been what caused this, because I truly felt like a kid again. It was great. The final battle scene was excellent; you certainly get enough bang for your buck here!In summation, this is certainly a film worth seeing amidst all the superhero films currently our there. If you are of my generation then I urge you to see this in the cinema, rather than watch it on DVD/Blu-Ray/digital later on. The big screen in addition to the Dolby surround surround sound made this an experience I am so happy to have had."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "A well tried attempt to cling to the nostalgia of the TV shows. Saban's Power Rangers offers what could be a fantastic retelling of the story that is, unfortunately, muddled down by poor pacing, oddly forced character development and cheesy references to its predecessor. While it does tease more, offering information for a sequel, let's hope that the DVD of this retelling offers more in a different cut."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Don't go in expecting top notch acting, effects or writing. This movie was never meant to be an example of film making excellence. It's a great teen movie. It combines elements of the drama kids go through nowadays and of course heroism and supernatural fiction. It's like Breakfast Club, Chronicles, Pacific Rim and even a bit of Toy Story 3 all combined. I laughed, teared up, threw my hands in the air, and even though I acknowledge it has its issues I enjoyed the heck out of it. The kids have to work on their acting, tho. The comedy was cheesy here and there but it's Power Rangers so what you expect? Also they touch very relevant issues, like mental illness, peer pressure, bullying, etc. And the importance of friendship and unity. It gets pretty emotional here and there. And it doesn't really piggyback that much on the nostalgia element, but when it does it hits you square in the Yay! bone. Go watch it. It's silly entertainment and cheesy fun at its best. Like the first Transformers. I even like it more than the first Transformers actually."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Hey i just saw the power rangers film it very good i really enjoyed the film i remember the original series when it was mighty morphing power rangers it was good to see the rangers back on the big screen i hope they do a second film I was very amazed at the film i liked it was very clean film they were awesome with it i like the new suites it was neat rita looked awesome but goldaer was different i like the original goldare i liked how they showed what zordon looked like i cant waite till it comes out on DVD and Blu-ray Go go power rangers"}]
