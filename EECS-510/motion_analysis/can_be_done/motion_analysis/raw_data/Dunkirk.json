This movie is definitely in my top 5 favourite movies."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "I'm giving this film a 6/10 because that's honestly what it deserves. When voting officially opened for this movie here on IMDb, it was at a 9.8/10. Are you kidding me? I'm sorry but I'm not going to be one of those people who just worships the ground Nolan walks on. I'm dead serious when I say Nolan could film himself taking a dump and people would rave about it.This movie is decent. It's better than your average war movie. A six out of ten is an appropriate rating for this film. The acting is good, which the film heavily relies on since there isn't a ton of dialogue. This is also probably Nolan's shortest film, which is also nice since he doesn't make you sit there and subject you to all sorts of his self-proclaimed \"mind-f***s\" and twists that he tries to throw at you. This movie doesn't try to out-think itself, which is fitting since a war movie doesn't need to be like that.All in all, it does what a war movie should do. Is it worthy of its current rating of 9/10 on IMDb? Absolutely not. Is it better than average? Yes."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Best war movie of all time a masterpiece by Mr Nolan.

Moreover, it's probably in my top 3 great history movies. I would recommend you all watching this movie, a piece of art."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Dunkirk marks Christopher Nolan's return to cinema and it is as bombastic as one would hope. Featuring a fractured sense of story telling, a shockingly great performance from Harry Styles and some of the most breathtaking cinematography I've ever witnessed, Dunkirk is without a doubt one of the most solid summer blockbusters in recent memory. Despite all that is perfect with the film, it does suffer from some glaring storytelling issues that, while many may enjoy, I found to be unnecessarily tedious.While many of you will probably hate on me for saying this, I simply have to say it: Christopher Nolan is overrated. There is no other way about it. The man has given us classics but flawed classics, at best. However, Dunkirk is a perfect response to my feelings towards Nolan. The film is extremely fast paced which is something that plagued Nolan since Batman Begins. Here, he is restrained and it pays off quite beautifully especially when you factor in the brilliance that is Hoyte Van Hoytema's outstanding cinematography. The film is big and Hoytema's determination is shown through every frame. He is dedicated to capturing beauty and here is no different. Hoytema serves as a very suitable replacement for Wally Pfister.The film, while being 106 minutes long and probably Nolan's most accessible feature to date, also is very scarce when it comes to dialog and general character development. There are very few characters here that will have you standing and cheering for. I mean, you're going to cheer at moments in the film. It is geared to do just that. But it won't have you gravitating towards Styles, Rylance, Hardy or Murphy. Quite frankly, they all have (with the exception of Styles) minimal screen time. Those looking for a Tom Hardy war movie better think again. This isn't about one soldier, it is about all of the soldiers. No one is more important than the other. Overall, Dunkirk is an exceptional addition to Nolan's impressive filmography. Crafting a unique war film that doesn't rely on overtly patriotic moments to move it forward is hard yet Nolan makes it seem effortless. The film relies on the courage and sheer will power of the human soul and that is something only the rarest of war films can do. Despite some wonky story telling, Dunkirk is nonetheless exhilarating and should absolutely be seen on the big screen."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "This movie by Christopher Nolan was a brilliant piece of work and will go down as his best Movie so far Fionn Whitehead was a fantastic choice for the lead role he amazed me in every possible way he will be the reason why this movie will win tons of awards Who would of thought that harry styles can act, of course I thought he was just being used as a tactic to bring in the young fans but he was surprisingly really good The movie was full of drama and action packed, had me on the edge of my seat the whole movie."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Great war movie, was blown away (no pun intended)! Get ready for an action packed adventure that tells a story of a war, a war where battles are fought and innocent men are killed. There's also a medic at some stage in the movie but I wont spoil it and tell you when. The only down point of the movie was the 40 minutes that Tom Hardy kept saying \"I'm on him\", it just seemed to get really repetitive. 10 out of 10 would recommend to consider watching this movie!"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Saw an early screening tonight in Denver.I don't know where to begin. So I will start at the weakest link. The acting. Still great, but any passable actor could have been given any of the major roles and done a great job. I know almost no more about the battle of Dunkirk after seeing the film than I did before, and I am not exactly a WWII historian. Truth be told, I learned all I know about the battle of Dunkirk from the movie poster. Does that weaken the film? Hell no, this is a film about survival. The opening scene tells it all and sets the stage as we get our first glimpse into a young soldier's need to stay alive, and his creative attempts to do so. That actor may even be considered the main character of the film. More words have been written so far in this review than he speaks. And I have no clue who the actor in that role is. It is humorous that Tom Hardy looks like Bane through most the film in the role of a pilot wearing an oxygen mask throughout. Kenneth Branagh is the only officer with any lines in the film, so that should give you an idea of the POV that we experience. We are the enlisted man trying to find a way to stay alive in a chaotic and harrowing battle. Though I believe Dunkirk will win every single technical Oscar, I would be surprised if it has any acting nominations at all.How does Nolan elevate this above other films of a similar nature? I think he says it best himself, when he describes Dunkirk as a thriller more than a war film. He pulls that off superbly.When a ship starts to take in water as numerous bullets penetrate its hull, I wanted to jump out of my seat and cover up the holes myself.The film has three separate stories that are titled Mole, Sea and Air. And we all know where Moles live. The way the narratives of the three stories unfold and how they are all tied together is what makes the film a masterpiece. Much has been said about Nolan using IMAX film cameras and how the film is enriched by this. I don't know. I doubt I saw actual film being projected at my screening. Every frame looked terrific though. So what is the most superlative aspect of the film? Gotta be the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer will win the Oscar for this without a doubt. So , so brilliant. This is not a soundtrack that I would buy at the store and play on my stereo. This is a soundtrack that weaves throughout the three narratives seamlessly and creates this phenomenal sense of tension. There are times when a two or three minute tense orchestral passage plays continuously as the story shifts from the ground to the sea then to the air and the music draws the three stories together. Zimmer's soundtrack reminds me of the way that Bernard Hermann's work was so vitally important in building suspense in most Hitchcock films. Though that description almost sells Zimmer short. His soundtrack is that good.I don't think this is a film that will retain even half of its strength in your home theater. No folks, this is a film that you cough up for an overpriced IMAX ticket and rationalize it by knowing that experiencing Dunkirk in any other fashion will just not cut it."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Nolan is a master of his craft. He really flexes his thematic muscles on every project. Amazing imagery and always has an impressive nack for telling a story. Stunning cinematography and A+ acting, easily one of the most intense movies I've ever seen. The more I recount it tho the more I am sure it was a love letter to the UK, which is a pretty charming sentiment. It seemed like a showcase of Brit grit in the face of overwhelming odds. Honestly at some points I felt I was watching a visual representation of a history textbook. Not really what I was hoping for but immensely entertaining. A very vague plot if one at all, just a series of truly jaw dropping events and character reaction. But maybe that's the point? Colorful examples of bravery and cowardice in the face of monumental situations; with unfortunately predictable reactions. But what are we to expect from a director who has mastered the alternative mind-bending fiction which has won our hearts for years? A director who's toes are just barely wet in the ocean of nonfiction narrative? He dives full confidence into the alien realm and newcomer Nolan scores an 8/10. A noble mark for my favorite filmmaker, credited with creating some of the best fiction ever written and displayed."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Utterly stunning in every department.

Did you actually see the film?"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Wow, but really.This movie should be seen on the biggest screen available (IMAX very recommended). The Sound mixing and editing are so amazing that in some scenes the whole theater trembled like in an earthquake.For very long moments Dunkirk acts like a horror film. The Germans are the Unseen enemies of the movie that just want to destroy the British heroes. Like the Joker of The Dark Knight they are very scary and you never know when they will attack.It's been 2 days after I watch the movie and some scenes from it not yet leave from my head. Christopher Nolan isn't just a good director but, alongside Edgar Wright, the real superhero of this summer."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Few directors have such a reputation that the release of their new film is an event and Christopher Nolan is one of those and Dunkirk is certainly an event. Based on what had the making of a military disaster the Allies are cornered on a beach in Dunkirk with the Germans drawing in and massive Allied casualties followed by the invasion of Britain almost inevitable.Initially focusing on one soldier, Fionn Whitehead, who joins the thousands of British troops trapped on the beach waiting to be evacuated the film opens out into three distinct areas, The Mule, essentially a pier where the massed troops wait to board naval ships overseen by Kenneth Branagh's naval commander , The Sea, which focuses on a small leisure boat captained by Mark Rylance and his two sons who cross the channel in their bid to help with the evacuation and The Air where spitfire pilot Tom Hardy and two other pilots attempt to shoot down various German Luftwaffe planes intent on bombing the rescue ships at sea as well as the troops on the shore line. Each story ties in with the other and Nolan's script cleverly shows the same moment from the three view points usually with a dilemma within each.It's a credit to the cast that despite the paucity of dialogue all are uniformly good. Fionn Whitehead is a unifying thread throughout the film as he lurches from one life threatening crisis to the next. Rylance & Brannagh are stoic & brave each aware of the desperate situation they are in and poor old Tom Hardy, much like Bane in 'The Dark Knight Returns', spends the film with his face covered by a pilots mask with only his eyes to convey the ever worsening situation he's facing. Even little pop moppet Harry Styles acquits himself well.Nolan handles all this brilliantly but what really takes this into another league is Hans Zimmer's music. Relentless, it compliments the action ratcheting up the tension to a nerve shredding crescendo. This is so brilliantly done that certainly the film feels like one long frighteningly real action scene albeit a true one. Nolan, together with Zimmer and his Editor Lee Smith, have put together one of the best Summer blockbusters this year made all the more extraordinary by having almost no dialogue but letting the pictures paint the scene. Shot in Imax 70mm its certainly worth seeing it this way as its immersive nature takes you headlong into the action which will have your heart beating as loud as anything in the film with its all too real explosions and its terrifying fighter plane engines screaming as they hone in on the exposed troops. If there's any justice at next years Oscars then Nolan, Zimmer and Lee should, at the very least, be nominated.This is an extraordinary film of a moment that was far from the military's finest hour and though the soldiers are the first to admit that, 'All we did was survive', it's a tremendously patriotic film about the courage, not just of the soldiers, but of the civilians who selflessly took their own boats across the channel to rescue thousands and thousands of troops. This is a testament to the courage of the few for the many and is sure to feature in many top ten end of year lists and rightly so."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "When Christopher Nolan announced that his next movie was going to be about World War II, people were skeptical; they had their doubts. But people had their doubts when Heath Ledger was cast as The Joker and Nolan proved them wrong. With Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan has hit the bull's eye. He has proved once again that no matter what his films are about, they are always going to be an amazing experience.Dunkirk is a film about the Dunkirk Evacuation ( Operation Dynamo ) that took place during the World War II. In 1940, more than 4,00,000 soldiers were evacuated on the beaches of Dunkirk, a small French town. Dunkirk is a story about that miraculous event.It is an unusual film. What I mean by that is, any moviegoer going into the movie would not expect the kind of film he would see. Most of you may have seen Saving Private Ryan and will be hoping for something similar but Dunkirk will throw you off balance. It is the complete opposite of Saving Private Ryan and that is why it shines so much.It is an experience and not a story about some individuals. There are no character backstories, so you won't get to know much about the characters. **You are in the battle from the first scene itself and you are going to stay there for the next 107 minutes.** You feel like a ghost watching the brutality of world war with your own eyes (Thank god, most of the war is bloodless).** There is very less dialogue, which you may hate, but it is also a unique thing about this masterpiece.** It is a no bull crap approach towards war. The war is not forgiving; you won't get time to shave your beard or shake hands with your friends or talk about your high school crush when each step you take may decide your fate. It is war and it translates to death if you are not careful. It is about people fighting for their lives and wondering if they will be able to make it through.The lack of character backstories and dialogue may be a shortcoming of the film but the more I think about it, the more sense it makes.** It results in a film that is thrilling, intense and nerve- wracking from beginning to end; there are no scenes that kill the tension.** Also, It does not politicize or glorify anything. It just shows you the war in its most raw form. It is terrorizing from the first scene till the last. There is almost no CGI; the IMAX cameras were placed on real airplanes and the film was shot, It makes my jaw drop in awe.***Dunkirk is the most realistic depiction of war I have ever seen on screen.***The cinematography is gorgeous and you will wonder how the DOP Hoyte van Hoytema was able to film it. The sound editing and mixing is on spot (Hans Zimmer's name is enough). The bullets sound exactly like bullets and the explosions are like real explosions; you won't get the feeling that Michael Bay is trying to blow things up. Last but not the least, what to say about the genius - Christopher Nolan. Most of his recent films have focused more on the crazy ideas and visual wonders but **Dunkirk proves that apart from being a person who has some amazing ideas, Nolan is a great storyteller too.** His storytelling abilities shine in Dunkirk. He himself is the writer and without his writing, it would not have been the film it is. he uses the nonlinear narrative and plays with the concept of time, again in a very effective way.***With Dunkirk, Nolan has established himself as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.***It is the best film he has made since Inception. It is a strong contender for the Academy Award for best picture and Nolan himself may get nominated for Best Director, a recognition that he truly deserves. With Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan has hit the bull's eye. He has proved that no matter what his films are about, they are always going to be an amazing experience. Just go and make sure you watch it on an IMAX screen."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Back in high school i wrote an essay on what happened at Dunkirk. And i was especially intrigued by Hitlers major blunder to not attack the beach with his tanks. If he had done so, the outcome of world war 2 could have been very different. It was one of the biggest mistakes Hitler ever made, and we should probably be quite happy about that.When i heard Nolan was going to make a movie about this, i was afraid he would paint the wrong picture and not tell the entire story. Nolan is good at bringing in nuances in his films, but i was still afraid he might forget about the French and the Belgians. And focus entirely on the British.Turns out, this movie is not at all what i expected. This is not the kind of movie you go see to get a history lesson. Nolan does not go into specifics on what led up to this point in history, and the movie has no character buildup. The movie starts where many other films ends their second act, right in the middle of the action. What this movie does is to focus on the share terror of war, and we see it from the viewpoint of the trapped soldiers on the beach of Dunkirk. Awaiting their fate, totally surrounded, hundreds of thousands of them.The movie tells three main stories. One on land, one at sea, and one in the air. And it jumps forward and back in time, so you feel you lose total control. And that is exactly what this movie needs, this is all about not being in control. German planes do regular sweeps, dropping bombs on the beaches. Planes and u-boats bombing and torpedoing the English warships. And the allied soldiers just standing there, with nowhere to run, they are basically just target practice for the planes. Who will survive? What would you do to try and survive? How would the consequences of your actions afflict you and your fellow soldiers?All these questions are at the very core of the film, it is all about survival in the darkest of times, and the movie is carried by Hans Zimmer's hypnotizing score which feels like a psychotic hymn that drills into your subconscious and attack your senses with brute force. It is accompanied with ear deafening sound effects that pound your ears until you feel very unsettled. The imagery presented here are outstanding, with lots of wide open shots in insane resolution. Never have i felt a movie so claustrophobic, using so many wide and open shots. This movie is indeed best viewed on a huge cinema screen.War is hell, war is chaos, and rarely has it been displayed better than in this film. Nolan has again showed that he can master almost any type of storytelling, and this time he even wrote the script himself. There are times in the film it feels like it might get a bit too sentimental, or that the film overly focuses on a few things that i feel i didn't need to be told again and again. But not before i start to get those feelings, it drags me back in with yet another pounding action scene.This is like nothing i have ever seen before. It is a war movie told in an unusual way. The movie doesn't have much dialogue, most of this movie is expressed through the eyes of the characters. And the terror in those eyes when the German bombers comes diving down for another sweep, making the most terrifying screaming noise, speaks louder than words. There aren't really any main movie stars in this film, it's the event itself, and the terror of war that is the primary character. And with the great cinematography, the loud sound effects, the pulsing music score, and the intense battle sequences, you feel like you are right there, on that beach. And that is probably the last place you would ever want to be. It is an intense thriller packed with suspense from the very first frame to the last, it never let's go.This will be a strong contender for many movie awards this year, and it's one of Nolan's best movies so far. That is saying something indeed, the man has a habit of making quite good films.Highly recommended"}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "There's no denying director Christopher Nolan has pretty much been crowned the torch-bearer for smart, contemporary, mainstream entertainment ever since The Dark Knight (2008). The fact that he backs up his visionary works with intelligently written screenplays and analog bonafides - such as real special-effects and shooting on film, only further engenders him to the minds of film aficionados. There's no denying he's one of us - a filmic omnivore and true believer in the power of the form who not only adores the trappings of his craft but is willing to subject his carefully crafted stories to obsession, scrutiny, and obsessive scrutiny a la constant fan theories.Thus saying Nolan's newest movie Dunkirk isn't all that and a bag of potato chips, actually hurts to say. Whatever misgivings anyone has had about Nolan - his characters lack emotion, his stories too heady, his pacing, so syncopated as to be robotic, have all come home to roost in this one. What's more, you can add loud, fractured, disorienting and at only 102 minutes, overlong to the list of complaints.Of course that may be part of the point. The evacuation of Dunkirk was, no doubt a fractured, loud and disorienting event for the over 450,000 soldiers who experienced it. The movie, re-cobbles the harrowing World War II military disaster from perspectives of land, sea and air; attempting to give the audience a fuller picture. The film opens with a nameless British soldier lining up on the beaches hoping for deliverance (Whitehead). We then jump to RAF pilots (Hardy and Lowden) providing what little air cover they can before tossing our hat in with Mark Rylance and his conscripted fishing trawler. In between these interweaving stories, we're reminded of the stakes by Commander Bolton (Branagh) who's exposition feels more like a godsend than a clunky add on.Yet even then Dunkirk can't help but feel like an ordeal. The non-linear storytelling (not just told from varying perspectives but also out of sequence) does little to immerse the audience into the film's claustrophobic settings. It doesn't draw attention or make comment like Rashomon (1950). It doesn't create the illusion of omniscience like in The Thin Red Line (1998). And it certainly doesn't get into the head space of the characters like in Slaughterhouse-Five (1972). It winds up forcing the viewer to continually update their context, using brainpower to figure out the time of day instead of caring about whether Tom Hardy is going to win his dogfight.Dunkirk does has a well received cousin in the form of A Bridge Too Far (1977), which similarly used fluid story dynamics and a large ensemble cast. In that regard Dunkirk improves on that formula by using mostly no-name and workmanlike character actors to do most of the heavy lifting. Yet A Bridge Too Far actually reached its climax. It did so through anticipation and dramatic irony. Dunkirk on the other hand starts at level eleven and stays there.This is turning into a much more negative review than is warranted. Dunkirk is still, for all its faults, a worthwhile movie. There are some masterful shots in this film, the immediacy of the situation is always clear and present and the utility of the IMAX format is on full display. If you don't believe me you can take the word of Christopher Nolan himself. Also while the score by Hans Zimmer is likely to be polarizing to some, I for one found it aptly encompassed what the movie was trying to achieve (even if it is too much of a good thing).Additionally the muted work of Fionn Whitehead, Aneurin Barnard, Cillian Murphy and the rest of the petrified soldiers is just excellent. With precious little dialogue and even less to differentiate themselves, these soldiers brilliantly capture the primal desperation and numbing exhaustion of the situation. Let it be said that out of all the sleek, heretofore unnecessary movie magic that Nolan employs, what saves this picture are the anonymous faces of horror who live or die based almost entirely on circumstance."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "I went into this film expecting a lot and got a lot more!Dunkirk is the story of the amazing efforts the British went to getting 300,000 men off the beaches of Dunkirk France, as they were surrounded and cut off by the German advances pushing them into the beaches and coastline. The directing was amazing, Nolan deserves an Oscar and several more nominations.The cinematography and sound by themselves are worth the effort of seeing this in a big screen cinema. The artillery felt so real, the camera angles fresh and vivid, just as real. In a little under 2 hours I felt happy, sad, tense, emotional, and finally very Proud.A must watch! An amazing film"}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Will Nolan ever let up? There was a time when the man was shooting on weekends with friends to produce something on a shoe-string budget to an unknown audience. His audience is now known as one of the widest, well-entertained yet not empty-headed and far from emotionally absent folk. And Dunkirk will meet all their expectations I'm sure. From the get-go we are presented with a three-sided structure to Nolan's war story - land, sea, air. Men on the beaches dive into the sand for cover whenever an enemy spitfire is heard overheard. We hear it just as clearly. The sound in this film is overwhelmingly phenomenal. Surely the best of the year. It doesn't let up when we cut to the air battle, swirling and tumbling planes guiding us through the open skies - all perfectly shot. Zimmer's score simply adds to the flavour, soaring as spectacularly as the spitfires themselves. In short, go see the film, you won't be disappointed. I saw it on a pretty big screen and you should do the same. It's a spectacle that must be experienced. I saw Baby Driver last week and this far surpasses that. Brilliantly edited, shot, and over it all, directed. If Chris Nolan doesn't at last get the nomination he's deserved for years at the Oscars it will be yet another criminal injustice committed by those fools."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Christopher Nolan returns with his next feature film, it's not a mind boggling sci-fi, human felt drama or even a grounded superhero epic but his latest offering Dunkirk is a film that not only feels and look like a war film but feels so close to being one through the eyes of Nolan.Based on three perspectives during the Dunkirk evacuation in the early stages of WW2 (a.k.a. Operation Dynamo), the film's story focuses on the solders on the beach trying to evacuate, the crew at sea attempting to reach them and the fighters in the sky, both defending them and attacking.As with tradition of Nolan's films, the film heavily focuses on the human aspect and spirit of survival. The horrors they had faced to escape from the attacking Germans frequently and the soldiers themselves facing shell shock and inexperienced, and while the violence isn't as graphic and brutal like other war films like Hacksaw Ridge, Fury and Saving Private Ryan, it seems to be grounded and yet realistic to the true story.On the technical side, visual effects are amazing with little to completely none CGI, most of the stunts and production design seems so realistic, Hans Zimmer's music score is one of his best works to date, suspense, dread and hopeful themes play in his work. Casting is spot on with solid performances throughout and Nolan's direction is true to the eye emotionally and visually.Overall, Dunkirk is realistic and true to the history's story, while more of a suspense film than a violent conflict between good and evil, it shows the dangers and the courage that all soldiers went through to make it out alive. With great direction, sound and practical special effects, music score and amazing production value, this possible future Oscar contender is well worth watching for all Nolan fans like myself and as well for war historian buffs.5/5 - Nick Christopher Nolan is not a director I like, and it's definitely one of the things me and Nick disagree on. For the first time ever I am pleased to tell you that I enjoyed this Nolan way more than is previous installments.Dunkirk is based on the true story. It was a tragic war. The moment the film starts you don't feel safe. It has you on the edge of your seat. The movie never really takes too long to get going either. We have all these different characters who are all on the same journey and have different paths they all meet on, and it all comes together very nicely.The performances were all fine. I thought the one that stood out was Cillian Murphy. He was a wreck and was suffering during this war and his acting clearly showed it.The sound and editing was spot on. Really breathtaking. You believe you are there with the planes and you feel the pain the soldiers are in. You just never know when gunfire is going to go off and who is going to get killed next in this horrible war.Not a fan of Nolan, but I will admit I really enjoyed Dunkirk. It's the first War Movie I know of that captures the feeling of suspense. Most war films rely on violence such as \"Saving Private Ryan\" or \"Hacksaw Ridge.\" Nolan uses his brain and gives us something more intelligent than just blood and guts splatted in our faces. He gives us a realistic film of hope, survival and how a nation can all come together to help one another out and fight a war that isn't theirs! Best Nolan film by far! 4/5 - Jay"}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Nolan delivers! I have never been that familiar with the whole WWII Dunkirk situation, which is something my brother (the war expert) wasn't very happy about. But, it's fair to say that I now understand what went down. You know how you usually get a lot of set ups or exposition before the action starts in war films? Well, here they throw that away and we open right in the middle of the entire evacuation crisis. The good thing is that I was almost immediately immersed by it. The story is told through three different perspectives; The soldiers on the beach, the people on the boats and the airplane pilots. All of the story-lines are well done. I cared for what was going on and I could feel the despair from everyone. There's not much dialogue which was refreshing because here there's room for the visual narrative to shine.I think my favorite perspective was from the pilots. You feel like you are up in the air with them and all of the wide shots of them flying were breathtaking. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is fantastic. The open sea setting was also great. I could almost smell the salt water. The spectacle and scope is off the charts in this film. It's not a character study, but more of an experience of putting you in the shoes of the people during the incident. Nolan succeeded in making everything look authentic because I did not notice any CGI. So, I believed that what I saw on screen was real. The best thing I can probably say is that I forgot people were acting or that the explosions were fake and so on. If someone says they didn't get much out of it, then I can understand. It doesn't give you a lot backstory or a specific main character to root for. We are basically presented with a glimpse of what happened in the lives of all of those people during the Dunkirk evacuation. We don't follow them before or after. And I don't think it was needed in this one. Sometimes it's better to leave that up to the imagination. Just the look on the people's faces was enough for me to understand them. The one complaint I can think of is that the music started sounding too much like a horror movie score at times. I get that war is horrific and all, but it got too on the nose and overplayed here and there. I would have preferred it to be more toned down.See it on the big screen, because the photography is executed so well it demands to be seen the right way. Also, be on the lookout for the Michael Caine cameo."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is brutal but surprisingly bloodless - the most blood on screen is probably when a character has an accidental fall in the stairs. It is also a total return to form for a director whose previous two outings were meandering, bloated messes.The movie follows three groups of people and their different timelines that are of uneven length. This causes some momentary confusion when things cut back and forth too often. But I guess this is not anything that a second viewing wouldn't fix.We get almost no background for the characters. Many don't even have a name and are limited to few lines of dialog. They are kept on screen for a time and then they are gone. Their stories start from random positions in their lives. Some go on living, some die useless, some die useful deaths. This may distance some of the audience from their fates to the degree that they become meaningless, but it certainly works better for Nolan than his sappy attempt to make sense of human emotions in Interstellar. Melodrama is not Nolan's thing. Tom Hardy gets to wear a mask for almost all of his screen time, just as in Nolan's last Batman.Zimmer's score is present literally throughout the movie. Thankfully he keeps himself perfectly in line with what is unfolding on the screen. The score still rings in your ears for a long time afterwards."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Now don't let the title fool you. I loved this film, but on our way home after seeing it, my brother, father and I discussed the grain on the film stock (we saw it on 70 mm, which was pretty cool), and we joked that it looked dirty and he coined the phrase \"better than dirt\".But let's get on topic, Dunkirk is an incredible film, and maybe Christopher Nolan's best, it's certainly up there. I think I would have to rate The Dark Knight and Inception higher, but Dunkirk could be in the Top 5 Chris Nolan films.As you probably would expect from Christopher Nolan, the film is a technical masterpiece. It was shot on 70 mm and IMAX, and boy did it pay off. The picture looked great, shot by the great Hoyte van Hoytema. It was also edited by Lee Smith and scored by Hans Zimmer. I really hope the film gets a lot of awards consideration in the technical categories, because they really deserve it.The level of suspense in this film is on an awesome scale. You're almost always on the edge of your seat, just waiting for something bad to happen. And when something happens, you definitely hear the noise and the music very clearly. It was actually so high that at one point, my brother who has sensitive hearing, had to hold his ears because it was so loud.I know the biggest criticism of the film is that people didn't care that much about the characters, because there is very little dialogue and the film starts right in the middle of it all, skipping all sorts of exposition. I can totally understand where they're coming from and that is definitely the weakest part of the film. But the reason why I cared about the characters was because Nolan did such a great job at creating a creepy atmosphere and you're just rooting for the soldiers to survive, and ultimately I think of the film really as an experience.I also want to give a quick shout-out to the historical accuracy. Now I can't say I Know the entire story of Dunkirk back to front, but I am aware of certain facts. It was really nice to see the French being depicted as the ones that were defending the beaches and many of them were sacrificed to let everyone else live. It would have been easy to exclude them, but Nolan is way too smart for that.So to conclude this review: Dunkirk is a great movie in a long line of great Christopher Nolan films. Probably the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan, and it was one of the best movie going experiences I've ever had. If you can see the film on 70 mm or on IMAX, do yourself a favor and watch it.My final score, 9/10"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "The cinematography, the scenarios... everything about this movie is epic and outstanding! Christopher Nolan is no doubt the best director of our times. I honestly would like to say something more but I honestly can't find words to describe how amazing and powerful this movie is! Nolan, thank you for making such incredible experiences! Now please go and watch this amazing movie! We all deserve it!"}, {"score": "3/10", "review": "Congratulations to the director for managing to make a movie that is physically painful. Maybe that is by design.A festival of cinematic nonsense, with an over the top and unnecessary loud scoring, lousy editing and a confusing timeline, all make for a masterpiece that I do not seem to \"get\". If you thought Interstellar was slow, boring and unnecessary, Mr. Nolan has somehow managed to set the bar a step higher."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Might as well get right to it, then. At the risk of sounding like a contrarian, I did not love this film. Do I love elements of this? Yes. Is this a 5-star masterpiece? Unfortunately, no. The cinematography here at least, is masterful. Director Christopher Nolan has, without a doubt, reached the pinnacle of on-screen spectacle here. The feats of practical effects in this film are breathtaking. The casting of nearly 6,000 extras, authentic WWII vehicles, and shooting on location in Dunkirk, France contribute to a great sense of scale here. There is ongoing trend of action films in recent years of relying on CGI, and thankfully Nolan bucks that trend. Similar to War for the Planet of the Apes, much of the film plays out without much dialogue, leaning on just the score and sound design in most scenes. It almost goes without saying that Hans Zimmer delivers with another incredible score. The sound design is also extremely well crafted, which, paired with Nolan's great work behind the camera, truly transports you to the Battle of Dunkirk. The wailing of planes passing above, the drone of gunfire, and the roar of explosions all contribute to the complete immersion into the world these characters are trapped in. This results in some of the most immersive wartime action scenes since Saving Private Ryan.This film has and will continue to be compared to World War II classic Saving Private Ryan. Both films are beautifully filmed WWII period pieces with casts that deliver great performances. The similarities end there. Whereas Saving Private Ryan was engrossing as a narrative due to it's characters with depth and arcs, Dunkirk instead leans on it's subject matter and spectacle.And while the subject matter of Dunkirk is fascinating, as a film it lacks emotional firepower due to the absence of a strongly written protagonist. This is strangely uncharacteristic of a director of Nolan's caliber, especially when you recall the complex character work in his most acclaimed films: The Dark Knight, Memento, and The Prestige. Instead of focusing on a single character or single group of characters, the focus is spread across three protagonists in completely different situations. Showing the Dunkirk Evacuation through the three different perspectives of those on the beach, the sea, and the air is only an interesting proposition on paper. The narrative, due to this writing choice, is spread far too thin, with few characters getting enough screen time to develop even the mildest emotional connection.While the characters in this film aren't written to even remotely be compelling, the great work from this cast is not to be overlooked. Harry Styles, known for being a member of English boy band One Direction, is surprisingly excellent here in his acting debut. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Fionn Whitehead also all give standout performances despite the limited screen time they are given. I should love this film. Historical drama? WWII setting? My favorite director Christopher Nolan? Amazing cinematography? Superb performances from an ensemble cast? All of these elements made me sure I would love this going in. But, Dunkirk's lack of emotional connection severely detracts from the awe-inspiring scope and technical prowess displayed. If I reviewed based on visuals alone, this is a slam-dunk, walk-off home run of a 5-star film. While a focus on grandeur and situation over character depth and emotion may work for some (it obviously worked for 98% of critics on Rotten Tomatoes), it did not work for this critic.This is without a doubt a cinematic achievement, but without an emotional core, it's impossible for this film not to feel cold and empty. Despite being a technical masterpiece, this is Christopher Nolan's most disappointing film yet."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "At this point, Nolan can make a Smurfs movie, and people are gonna still buy tickets and watch it. I'm not really into war movies, but I have seen war movies before like Saving Private Ryan and Hurt Locker. But no other movie in the world packs this much intensity. You know nothing about a character, you have no reason to like him, but you would still want him to survive. That's Nolan's magic. Previously Nolan set a benchmark for the Superhero movies, Mind benders, Sci-fi and now for War movies. Nolan and Zimmer worked in tandem to deliver a masterpiece that will set a standard for future war movies. This is probably the best cinematic experience I have ever experienced since Avatar. You will cry you will laugh, and you will awe every shot by Nolan. I hope Nolan and Zimmer will win Golden Globes and Oscar for this movie. I don't think anyone even deserves it more than these two do for this year."}, {"score": "5/10", "review": "It could've been an amazing documentary, had Nolan went a slightly different way with it. But as an action movie it's weak on action. As a drama it's weak on acting, character development and as whole completely failed to evoke any emotions in me.I didn't really care for any of the characters, there wasn't much happening at all and most importantly - for an \"ultra realistic war experience\" it lacked much in terms of actual realism and violence. You could feel the PG-13 in every scene, there's very little focus on suffering/death and it almost makes war look easy. I just expected the complete opposite from the reviews I've seen.I don't really get where Nolan was going with this. Loved every single one of his movies... until now."}]
