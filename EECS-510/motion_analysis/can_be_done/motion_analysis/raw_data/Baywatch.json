[{"score": "6/10", "review": "Baywatch is a movie based off the popular TV show of the same name which launched the careers of such acting talents as Yasmine Bleeth and Pam Anderson. And then those quickly died right afterwards but hey, the show ran like 11 years and\u0085little known fact, Jason Mamoa was on spin-off show Baywatch: Hawaii. The movie is very much like the show; as in if you walk in expecting to take it seriously you're already watching it wrong. The situations people need to be rescued from are just as ridiculous and far-fetched and the main plot here gets far more convoluted and hackneyed than the average day of any real lifeguard. And like 21 Jump Street and a bunch of lesser TV to movie adaptations, this seeks to make fun of all of it, plus all the slo-mo beach running. Does it come off as good as Jump Street? No. Do we need this? God no. I mean didn't the show basically already make fun of itself enough as it is?But all I can say here, and I guess the only thing anyone interested in this might want to know is, it could have been so much worse. I'm not saying this is the best movie of the summer so far. I don't really even know if i'm saying this is a good movie. But it's easy enough to sit through and the laughs, while not great, are consistent.Where the script sucks, the cast knows how to make fun of itself. The Rock is the head honcho who takes the job very seriously. Zac Efron is the selfish, cool pretty boy new trainee who clashes with him. Both have a plethora of jokes for one another that work with varying degrees of success. There's a fat lifeguard and the movie takes the shots you would expect it to take but actor Jon Bass also does have some comedic talent here in the Josh Gadd sense of the word. Actually he may even be funnier than Josh Gadd. Point is he works the best here from a comedic perspective. The movie gives us quite a few dick jokes but this dude actually has one embarrassing moment that may rank up there with \"There's Something About Mary\", just with not as good a payoff. Hannibal Burress also gets a couple scenes for a cameo and I love when he gets those. It's time for Burress to headline a movie though. The women aren't as funny but I guess you can say they add some nice support to that and the action. Alexandra Daddario has shown a few times she's a pretty decent actress, and the others don't just seem like stiffs there to just show off a hot body. Priyanka Chopra is also here as the villain, and she's fine. The whole movie can really be described as fine. It's funny and doesn't take itself too seriously and the cast all seems game for it. You don't have to see, but if you do, know it's already planning on sequels. But overall I say 6 out of 10.

Didn't we already do this with 21 Jump Street? This reboot has a lot of good parts that just couldn't come together to make a good movie. The plot was barely there and wasn't enough to string together the enjoyable bits, leaving the viewer with a feeling that something was off. There was no one bad thing about the movie and \u2014 to be clear \u2014 the cast and characters were great, the writing had its moments, the premise might have been successful had they tried a bit harder \u2013 but what we were left with instead was a lot of wasted potential, hanging plot points, and a bad taste in the mouth that most unnecessary reboots do."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson) is the head lifeguard and public face of Baywatch. He takes his job seriously and he not only saves lives but he's also beloved by everyone on the beach. The story picks up on a day where new recruits are trying out to enter Baywatch's training program. We meet a few of the possible finalists, they range from the enthusiastic Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario) to underdog Ronnie Greenbaum (John Bass). He's a regular on the beach but he spends his time drooling over lifeguard CJ Parker (Kelly Rohrback). Another potential lifeguard, Matt Brody (Zach Efron) is a former 2 time Olympic gold- medallist who has fallen on hard times. The head of the Baywatch program; Captain Thorpe (Rob Huebel) is shoving Brody down Buchannon's throat as he's only available to them through Brody's community service. Adding to Buchannon's troubles is business mogul Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra). She's swiftly gaining more power in the Bay area through her newly purchased club. Will Mitch be able to properly indoctrinate his chosen recruits and get to the bottom of Victoria's shady behaviour? I got to see Baywatch early through an advance screening. The success of the original Baywatch was something that didn't make sense. The show was before my time but it was regularly mocked for being extremely cheesy. People often used it as an excuse to check out Pamela Anderson and Yasmine Bleeth. So the 2017 movie version of Baywatch has to pay tribute to the source material yet update this story for a new generation. I'm happy to say that Baywatch has no problem making fun of it's roots and they often come up with creative ways to do it. They aren't quite as meta but the constant slow- motion running and these lifeguards working outside their job descriptions are repeatedly mocked and skewered. The overall plot is outlandish and ridiculous but the movie doesn't sidestep that issue, it addresses it continuously and has fun making fun of it alongside the audience. Does the movie drift too far into implausibility? Absolutely but you can't take this movie seriously. It completely unravels if you do. This isn't an issue just for Baywatch. If a movie can acknowledge how unrealistic it is, I can try to go along with it and Baywatch had the good sense to do this.I really liked most of the marketing for Baywatch but the movie I got to watch was different from what I expected. The trailers billed this as more of a straight comedy but this ended up being more of an action/comedy. The action in this is decent, the movie is pretty fetishistic for slow-motion but I would still give it a passing grade. They luckily keep most of it light and it largely looks good (minus some pretty bad looking CGI fire). But the reason to see this is the comedy. The movie relies on gross-out humour a little too much at points but the comedic dialogue was really solid and the theatre I saw it in was laughing throughout the movie. The strong chemistry between Dwayne and Zac helps and while I had some small issues with the jokes, I thought they were pretty good.This movie has a big and admittedly attractive cast that help this movie skirt around narrative issues. Dwayne is his normal charismatic self and his likable demeanour is key for this movie working. Zac shows again that he's an underrated comedic actor and he's really strong with The Rock and by himself. Kelly Rohrbach is funny but even the movie makes no bones about how she's there because of stunning she is. I liked Alexandra and Ilfenesh, both were good but the movie didn't give either of them much to do. I was kind of mixed on Jon Bass and I liked Hannibal Burress in his role. If someone surprised me it was Priyanka Chopra. Her character of Victoria is really clich\u00e9 and the movie seemed almost determined to make you roll your eyes whenever the story moves back to her. But through her ability and her charisma, she takes a lacklustre character and actually delivers a memorable performance.Getting to what I didn't like about Baywatch, the biggest thing is that the movie can't seem to quit while they're ahead. They fail to realize when to move away from certain jokes and they're guilty of this more than a few times. This is especially evident when you focus on Ronnie. Jon Bass is funny as this character but his awkwardness is dialed up so much that they run his material into the ground almost every time. It's also a little hard to determine how much Baywatch wants to be taken seriously. The movie goes for straight slapstick and then they will suddenly launch into how the Bay is in serious jeopardy without any transition. That kind of tonal switch can be done but they just couldn't sell it completely. This movie faces an uphill battle because it will be compared to cinematic success stories like 21 and 22 Jump Street. More recently, you also had the re-imagining of CHIPS. Does Baywatch hit that extremely high bar set by the Jump Street franchise? No but it also laps CHIPS pretty easily. The comparison to 21 Jump Street is fair with this being in the same genre but I feel like people forget how special those movies were. Jump Street came out of nowhere and they achieved universal acclaim when you just don't get that for comedies. Baywatch can't completely distract from how ridiculous the plot is and the movie needed a tighter edit. But the movie is really funny, it features a good cast of actors/actresses that sell out for it and the movie does a good job celebrating/making fun of it's source material. I might be in the minority for this one but I'd give it a 7.5/10 rounding up to an 8/10."}, {"score": "1/10", "review": "A little over 20 years ago, the world was introduced to Baywatch the TV show. This was an awesome show for any pre-pubescent boy or middle aged pervert who liked to watch Pamela Anderson run in slow-mo. Much like the TV show, the film is all brawn and beauty and doesn't have a brain cell to its name. Starring Zac Efron, Alexandra Daddario and Dwayne Johnson, the cast can't even save this atrocious excuse for a film. It is far from the comedic romp that was promised in the trailers. The film takes itself seriously and then other times it knows it is a parody. The only problem is, the filmmakers and writers can't decide on a tone. This really killed the film in more ways than one. Those who are expecting another Neighbors will be sorely disappointed and those of you wanting to see Dwayne Johnson kick some ass, you get to see that a little bit but there is much MUCH more to this film that could have been. I normally would go into a longer review and really talk about the film itself but I stopped myself short of this because any longer than this and it would simply be a waste of time, much like this film."}, {"score": "4/10", "review": "Here's my review of #Baywatch movie and the reason why I don't hate the film as much as someone who probably over analyzes it is that I wasn't expecting this to be any better than the long-running cheesy TV series that I did grow up watching. If you recalled, the show was basically just about attractive people in swimsuits patrolling a beach and it had the occasional soap opera romance. It produced such hot babes as Pamela Anderson, Brooke Burns, and Yasmine Bleeth. Teenage boys watched it religiously whenever they can't get their hands on a copy of the latest Playboy magazine.With that said, this movie throws the drama out the window and cranks up the sex- crazed raunchiness that the TV version could only hint mildly. The action sequences are not well-staged, the jokes more than often don't land, but from time to time it does exactly what it's supposed to do, it entertains.Starring Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron, Priyanka Chopra, Alexandra Daddario, Jon Bass, Kelly Rohrbach, Ilfenesh Hadera, directed by Seth Gordon, the story is about veteran lifeguard Mitch Buchannon who finds himself butting heads with a brash new recruit, 2-time gold medalist named Matt Brody (Zac Efron) who thinks highly of himself. Meanwhile, a certain local criminal plot is operating an underground drug ring that threatens the future of the Bay.This is a movie that from the start wants you to know that it doesn't intend on taking itself too seriously. There are scenes that I'm thinking the writers and director thought were going to be solid when they viewed them during storyboard process perhaps, but on screen, they're actually uneven and off-putting.The whole crime investigative aspect of it is anything but smart, sure one can argue that's because these guys are lifeguards and not cops, a point which by the way keeps being hammered again and again throughout the course of this film, but what I mean is that there really is nothing clever about solving the drug ring because everything about it is obvious and out in the open. But I am a sucker for a comedy about nerd guys and hot girls falling for each other and so I find the dynamics between Jon Bass' character and Kelly Rohrbach's character to be adorable, it's like those impromptu in-between moments that I consistently look forward to.Overall, I think people are going to want to watch this movie for the very same reason they watched the TV series, and that is: the beautiful people. Girls will come for shirtless Zac Efron and beefcake Dwayne Johnson, and guys will come for Kelly, Alexandra, Priyanka and their voluptuous bodies, I'm just keeping it real. Attractive people in swimsuits have always been the essence of \"Baywatch,\" they are what this franchise banks on. So the story quality and the jokes may not be up to par, they're silly, they're lousy, they're ridiculous, but \"Baywatch\" has an unlimited supply of sex appeal.-- Rama's Screen --"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "This movie is hilarious!

Sure, it was popular but for reasons very different to it actually being a quality show. It was trashy as hell and combined slow-motion with a number of scantily clad supermodels running down the beach in bathing suits so no surprises at all that it attracted viewers. There seems to be a bit of a trend in reviving franchises that were popular back in the 80s and 90s, and right now, it was the turn of Baywatch. Quite why is something that I'm still scratching my head about.When Mitch Buchanan (Dwayne Johnson) butts heads with new recruit Matt Brody (Zac Efron) over how to run Baywatch, they uncover a local criminal plot that threatens the future of the bay. As soon as the film started and we see Dwayne Johnson saving someone before Baywatch rises from the sea in giant letters behind him, I immediately thought this was going to be exactly what a Baywatch film should be if it was to be successful. A self aware comedy made as a parody of the show, in the same way that made the Jump Street films such a critical and financial success.We get flashes of that formula however, for the most part, Baywatch is just an awful film. Painfully unfunny and not one memorable action sequence means it utterly fails as the action comedy it set out to be, and with a runtime of two hours it becomes one hell of a slog to sit through. I tried to enjoy it and take it for what it is but the problem is I just can't do that when there seems to be no effort into making the film funny, particularly when watching a comedy. Literally every other joke is a dick joke, including an overly long joke about one of the new recruits getting their dick stuck in a deck chair. I knew it was going to be silly and I didn't have high expectations at all but sadly they weren't even met.Coming to the performances, Baywatch is absolutely lifeless. Even Dwayne Johnson or Zac Efron, who has shown good comedic timing before, can't save this from becoming the absolute car wreck that it is. Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach and Ilfenesh Hadera are sure nice to look at but the film fails them totally in giving them anything interesting to do, Daddario in particular who is actually quite a talented actress. Then there is Jon Bass who delivers an irritant of a performance as he hopelessly lusts after Rohrbach's CJ Parker. I felt embarrassed for them as they had to perform such a terrible script.I won't even waste time in talking about the pathetic cameo that David Hasselhoff makes in the film. All I will say is what a waste of a cameo that had much better potential if they'd actually stopped to think about it. So there you have it, Baywatch is an awful film that fails as both an action and a comedy. It's already one of the worst films I've seen this year and I won't be surprised if it's still up there come the year's end."}, {"score": "2/10", "review": "Comedy is dead. Baywatch has made me lose any hope of any movie being funny in 2017. If this is the best Hollywood can do, they are done for.There is no inspiration or creativity to be found. The idea is: Hey, 21 Jump Street was hilarious! What would happen if we did the same thing for (fill in the blank)? 21 Jump Street was one of the rare occasions where a TV-adaptation film was worth seeing, and ultimately, ended up being better than the source material. What was Baywatch originally? A horrible TV show in the 80's. It existed only to show off the glistening, bouncing, beautiful bodies of it's lead actors David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson. There isn't much material to make a film off of. That is, unless, the filmmakers went nuts and turned the source material into an absurd farce.. lets say of the Will Ferrel variety. Instead, Baywatch 2017 is a lopsided, painfully stupid, unbearably dull, cringe- inducing insult to the intelligence of the filmgoing public. Pain and Gain had more nuanced humor. Mike and Dave was the funnier Zac Efron movie. Let that sink it.I might have said, \"This makes no sense\", out-loud in the movie theater about 10 times. They made a film completely out of action-comedy clich\u00e9s, strung together incoherently. The big laugh set- pieces are desperate. One joke in particular is a genital mishap lifted directly from \"There's Something About Mary\". That joke is 20-years old. If you're going to be a thief, at least steal something timely.

I know that when I go to a comedy I expect to laugh. Baywatch rarely delivers enough action or comedy to keep the film from moving at a begrudgingly slow pace.So, if it's not funny then what's the point? Well, there really isn't any. Baywatch attempts to follow in the same line with films like Fast and Furious where silly humor and visceral action lead the way. But there's a big difference here. Where in other films it feels funny because the characters inside the story don't realize how serious they're taking the situations they're in, it's the opposite with Baywatch. It almost feels like the characters in Baywatch know they are in a ridiculous comedy and continue to act like it, coming ever too close to winking at the camera at times.Films like that only work if the tone is just right. It's very difficult to pinpoint who exactly this film is targeting. You'd think it's the R rated comedy crowd, but the film recycles so many old jokes and comedy tropes that I would find it difficult for anyone to get super invested. When the jokes aren't hitting you have to look to the characters for something to grapple onto. All of these actors and actresses are beautiful to look at, but besides Zac Efron's character, none of them are fleshed out. In my mind The Rock can do no wrong, but I certainly would have expected more out of him (especially considering he helped produce this as well).The worst part is that you can see every story beat coming. You know when someone is going to get the girl or guy they want, you know when they won't, you know when the characters are about to go through a big moment, and you know when the big gag or joke is about to hit. I didn't even mention how pointless and out of place the cameos feel. I haven't seen all of Seth Gordon's directorial efforts, but I really enjoy Horrible Bosses so I expected to at least get a kick out of Baywatch/superheroes on the beach, but it wasn't meant to be.

Ratings for NBC's skin-tastic lifeguards-save-L.A. action-drama placed it in 73rd place out of 103 shows for the 1989-1990 television season\u0085 and its studio (GTG) went out of business. But, as Norm McDonald used to remind us from the desk of SNL's Weekend Update, \"Germans LOVE David Hasselhoff.\" (And people in lots of other countries do too!) Keeping the show from becoming a footnote in TV history, series star David Hasselhoff brought it to first-run syndication, where it ran from 1991-1999. Having become an international sensation, it then continued in a new setting, with a mostly new cast and under a new name, \"Baywatch Hawaii\", for two more seasons. Along the way, the show became a major part of the careers of Hasselhoff, Pamela Anderson, Alexandra Paul, Yasmine Bleeth, Carmen Electra, Brooke Burns, Parker Stevenson and many others. Given the show's small screen stamina and enduring popularity, it seems natural that the TV show \"Baywatch\" would eventually become the movie \"Baywatch\" (R, 1:56), much like \"CHiPs\" earlier in 2017. Unfortunately, much like \"CHiPs\", the big screen \"Baywatch\" sucks.On a Florida beach, Lt. Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson) leads a group of lifeguards that he calls \"the elite of the elite\". Mitch himself has over 500 water rescues under his\u0085 trunks, while teammates Stephanie Holden (Ilfenesh Hadera) and C.J. Parker (Kelly Rohrbach) are similarly brave and skilled. In order to expand their team, Mitch and company hold try-outs for an additional three lifeguard slots. The new trainees end up being: the beautiful and brainy Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario), an awkward, out-of-shape but hard-charging nerd named Ronnie (Jon Bass) and Matt Brody (Zac Efron), a cocky, selfish 2-time Olympic gold medalist in swimming, who has since become persona non grata in the swimming world \u2013 and in society. (His new job somehow counts as community service for unspecified legal trouble.) As Ronnie harbors a not-so-secret crush on C.J., and Brody flirts with Summer, training commences. Brody has to learn what it is to be a real team player and that there is more to being a lifeguard than just being able to swim fast. Meanwhile, a local police officer (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), Mitch's supervisor (Rob Huebel), and even Brody, want Mitch to learn that he is a lifeguard \u2013 NOT a cop.The reason that Mitch and the other lifeguards feel the need to act like cops is found in the person of Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra from TV's \"Quantico\"). She's the new owner of a bayside resort called The Huntley Club and it looks like she's up to no good. We hear her accused of running drugs\u0085 and she doesn't deny it. We see her colluding with a city councilman (Oscar Nu\u00f1ez) on some real estate deal\u0085 and see bribes him with an expensive watch. We understand that Mitch doesn't trust her\u0085 and she invites him to a party. At this \"meet the neighbors\" gathering, Mitch and company do their best to dig up some dirt to back up their suspicions, but Leeds is a wily woman and proof is harder to find than body fat on Dwayne Johnson or Zac Efron. When packets of a dangerous designer drug pop up, plus a suspicious fire and a couple of corpses, naturally it's up to a few lifeguards to solve the mystery, right? That's what the Baywatch babes and boys think anyway. And that's just part of what's wrong here.\"Baywatch\" is mostly ridiculous and unfunny. What passes for character development are back stories which raise more questions than they answer. What passes for acting are one-dimensional characterizations which aren't believable or even sensical. And what passes for humor basically falls into one of three categories: references to the areas of the human body usually covered by swim suits, vomit jokes and seeing how many pop culture references Mitch can come up with to insult young pretty boy Brody (although some were funny) \u2013 and the best gags are all in the theatrical trailers. The screenplay, by writing partners Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, puts the characters in situations which are more insulting to the intelligence of the average Movie Fan than they are humorous. Seth Gordon's direction is too weak to make sense of it all or to give the audience more than a few chuckles along the way.The acting is across-the-board bad, but the worst of the worst is a tie between Bass, for simply doing a 2-hour Josh Gad impression, and Chopra, for showing nowhere near the gravitas or menace necessary to be an effective villain\u0085 with a (dis)honorable mention to the usually entertaining Johnson, who ends up in his worst role since 2013's \"Pain & Gain\". For a few amusing moments and for poking self-aware fun at its source material, the film scores minor points, but it basically can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a parody or a drama and it doesn't do any of those very well. (But don't gloat Dax Shepherd. \"CHiPs\" made most of the same mistakes.) \"Baywatch\" would be better titled \"No Way Watch\". This movie is as lame as that pun I just made.

Robbie K here to ask that question as I hit the theater trenches to scope out the wonders the bay holds in this relaunch. So once more, here are my thoughts on the latest \"hits\" of the Hollywood Box Office!\"LIKES: \u0095 Some of the comedy \u0095 The Beautiful Cast \u0095 Dwayne the Rock JohnsonSummary: If you've seen the trailers, you know this movie is going to attempt to be funny, and at times it succeeds. Despite what some reviews say, Baywatch has its clever moments involving slapstick humor and insult bashing. There are numerous references buried in the sand of this movie, and even more punches at the ridiculousness of the legendary series. These quips are fun, tasteful, and on many levels so true at how we ate up the drama. And yes, the cameos are certainly fun to watch and well-timed. But outside of comedy, the main selling point of this movie is the beautiful cast of lifeguards assembled for this movie. The trailers have not sold you any lies in regards to the anatomy in this movie and the sex appeal contained within. Female audience members will certainly enjoy the chiseled features of former wrestler Dwayne Johnson and former Disney Channel singing \"sensation\" Zac Efron. Beefy bodies and plenty of shirtless scenes had a number of my fellow audience members drooling, or at least making sounds. Fear not guys, you'll get plenty of chances to make your own sounds and gawk at the lovely figures of Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach, and Ilfenesh Hadera These visions of loveliness not only have a little spice to add to the mix, but plenty of \"bounce\" to their step that brings energy to the film. In regards to the acting of most of the cast, not bad I must say, but many are reduced to mere shadows of what I had hoped to see. All with the exception of one\u0085.The Rock is still cooking up a storm in terms of his acting. He led the comedy for me with solid delivery and timing, his lines perhaps the best written of the whole cast. Using his physical attributes, he does some nice stunt work into the mix helping to add excitement to a rather bland movie. But his greatest contribution is the energy brought to the film, which kept things fun, balanced, and moving at various points. You can guess that this reviewer felt the most solid aspect of the movie\u0085 was the Rock. DISLIKES: \u0095 Most of the comedy \u0095 Predictable story \u0095 Zac Efron's characterSummary: I said there was some witty moments, but we all knew this was going to be a run of the mill modern comedy. Baywatch is loaded with shallow comedy that is stupid, crude and in many cases lazy writing. You can guess that much of it is centered on the stereotypical sex jokes, including a few shots of the genitalia itself. Other comedic ploys focus on prolonged banter between two characters, who randomly stop in the middle of a crisis to argue their points\u0085yeah that's funny. Yet many jokes involve taking the clever dialogue and quickly dumping it for\u0085yes pointless cursing that quickly grew stale for me.You would think the story could try to make up some of the shortcomings, but no\u0085 that too failed. It was a predictable plot from start to finish, with all the relationships, turning points, and big twists known within probably 30 minutes. While this should not be too startling, I had hoped that the stunts and suspense could break it up the mundane plot, but this too failed considerably. I get it, it's a cute attempt at making an extended episode reminiscent of the show, but the execution was poor and I think that a stand-up comedy approach might have been better. Yet the worse thing for me was Zac Efron's character. Don't turn click off the review quite yet, hear me out, this is in no way all Efron's fault. The former High School Musical star is playing the same role he always does and is starting to go off the deep end. However, the design of this character was annoying on so many levels that it was hard to not wish a swift end for him. The development was weak at best, minus a few well-developed scenes, and the fact that he had some of the lamer comedic moments didn't help things at all. But when you got the body he built up, I guess you don't have to do much in this movie to win the favor of the audience. The VERDICT:Baywatch is clever at times and fulfills its promise of shallow laughs, Dwayne Johnson having energy and of course the sex appeal. They certainly polished their actors for this one so that audiences would get a feast for their eyes, but sadly that's the only thing this reviewer can share. Baywatch has much balancing to do for the sequel that could come, and really needs to focus on the wittier comedy and less on the innuendos. Certainly, you should hold out for this movie to grace Netflix or RedBox. My Scores are:Action/Comedy/Drama: 5.5 Movie Overall: 4.0"}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "It's a warm, beautiful day on the beach. The pristine waves crash gently against the sand as the sun-kissed folk of Southern Florida come out to play. Lifeguard Post 1 stands like a sentinel - its windows permanently cocked forward towards the horizon. There's a change in the wind. A wind surfer looses control of his sail and is catapulted upward towards the sky before plummeting, head first into a coral reef. He's knocked unconscious...all seems lost. Then Mitch Buchannon (Johnson) appears on the scene.What results is a valiant rescue that inexplicably involves slow-motion running, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson flexing his pectorals underwater, fireworks and dolphins for some reason. The movie could have stopped right there as by that point we got the best version of what could have been the cinematic version of a far-fetched TV show. Unfortunately the first fifteen minutes aren't so much a harbinger of the hilarity to come but rather a visual metaphor for the movie's inflated sense of self.The film energetically sets up its main characters with all-too-brief introductions on tryout day. We immediately endear ourselves veterans Stephanie (Hadera), C.J. (Rohrbach) and Mitch as they judge incoming trainees the tough and brainy Summer (Daddario), the dorky Ronnie (Bass) and disgraced former Olympic swimmer Matt Brody (Efron) whose ego Mitch sees as a liability. Much of the film's prouder moments are spent with The Rock and Efron doing what they do best; The Rock deflating Brody's ego with real-deal charisma and action hero one-liners - Efron playing the dim-witted, put-upon jock who deserves everything he has coming to him because he was in High School Musical (2006).But just when you think everything will turn out for this movie, the narrative drastically shifts to a crime story that stops the movie's momentum cold. The narrative thrust involves the new owner of the beach's fancy yacht club (Chopra) and her suspicious connection to a new designer drug called Flaka. The rest of the movie doesn't so much spend time exploring that connection or its implications (Chopra compares herself favorably to a Bond villain pretty much from the get go) but instead it lays every aspect of the conspiracy out on the table and waits for the lifeguards to connect the dots.This ploy not only doesn't work but it basically splits Baywatch into two completely unsatisfying pieces. The first piece brings a diversity of comic set-pieces which on their own, probably couldn't make a good sketch on Key and Peele (2012-2015). They lack a depth of character requiring one or two of them to be more gullible, less resourceful or otherwise dumber than what was previously established.The other half of the movie plants its flag firmly on The Rock's ability to recap what we already know while Priyanka Chopra chews unhelpfully on the scenery until the timer runs out. All throughout the film drops hints that you should care about this or that - an insert shot of a watch brings more pause than a fiery boat rescue. Yet because nothing new is ever revealed, the film's call for attention becomes soporifically annoying.The overall tone of the film is also aggressively reductive, treating the, in retrospect quaint misogyny of the original series with an uncomfortable amount of contrarian glee. Every time one of the girls of Baywatch justifiably call out the boys for being pervs, the payoff by the end of the film amounts to nothing more than quid pro quo ribbing or worse - they end up with the dude at the end. If Baywatch had just treated the subject as window-dressing, I might have been inclined to let it go (after all trash TV is trash TV). Unfortunately the movie stops just short of waving its d**k in the air while saying \"you think we're being sexist, f**k you bruh!\" Thus I think its worth a brief mention.Baywatch has all the necessary ingredients to make a pretty satisfying comedic soup. Unfortunately apart from The Rock and Efron standing out as the film's sole saving graces, everything else is squandered on a useless story, oblivious editing and a unifying tone that's unnecessarily combative. Unless you're the type of person who truly believes Kelly Rohrbach's slo-mo runs along the beach are enough to maintain your attention, I suggest skipping out on this aggressively unfunny movie.On a related note: Stop with the dorky guy gets the hot girl for doing nothing clich\u00e9. It's been done a hundred times before, you're bringing nothing new to the table and it's come to the point where if you do it at all it just feels icky. The Sam Witwickys of the the world should have to, you know, work for it now."}, {"score": "1/10", "review": "So I always liked Reno 911 but it was only so-so funny.And they actually did a movie with The Rock in it.After seeing this movie I was reminded of that bad movie,and it turns out both share some of the writers.Reno 911: Miami was terrible TV to Movie adaptation,this is even worst."}, {"score": "1/10", "review": "This movie is not funny at all and just objectifies women .

That movie wasn't much better. Oh well. Just don't see this bastardization of Baywatch. Not funny, crude and filthy (and not in a good way). As far as titillation goes, guys you'll be better off with a beach/car wash flick from the late 80s."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "In \"Baywatch\" beauty doesn't conquer stupid. It ends up a tie at best, on points. People Magazine's 2017 Sexiest Man Alive Dwayne Johnson, \"The Rock\", stars as iconic lifeguard Mitch Buchannon in Director Seth Gordon's \"Baywatch\"\u2014his recreation and homage to the worldwide TV syndication phenom. All the lifeguards, sans one by narrative, are stunningly beautiful. In reassuring self-mockery Gordon vividly recreates the classic \"slow-mo\" running shots of his stars in homage to the original series. In the introductory beach sequence, wannabe life guard Ronnie, played by charming soft-bodied geek Jon Bass, gazes longingly at the crush of his life C.J. Parker, played by beautiful, sweet former Sports Illustrated Model Kelly Rohrbach, as she runs emerging from the ocean. It's a shame on several levels, because the cast like Rohrbach and Johnson are amazingly beautiful, and they are also charismatic, funny, and charming. Unfortunately, those attributes are distinctly lacking in Damian Shannon and Mark Swift's dreadfully erratic screenplay. A real embarrassment. Along with Rohrbach and The Rock, Zac Efron and Alexandra Daddario bring their comically charming A-games. Efron is totally jacked; his body is ripped beyond, giving even The Rock competition. Efron plays disgraced 2-time Olympic swimming Gold Medalist bad-boy Matt Brody, a thinly veiled caricature of Ryan Lochte. Except here, Efron infuses more heart and character to bear as Brody. Daddario plays Summer, the young marine biologist whose dream is being the lifeguard who saves others. Efron's Brody quickly falls for Summer upon their meeting at Baywatch tryouts. Daddario endures the movie's blatant boob punch line, brilliantly understating her smarts, and radiance. Well, nuance is not inherent to \"Baywatch\" given the campy source material of the TV series. However, the narrative tonal currents make your headache. At the lifeguard tryouts Johnson's Mitch iterates that at Baywatch, \"We save lives.\" In the awesome opening scene Mitch courageously saves an unconscious surfer from certain death. Later Mitch and Brody dramatically save the drowning Mother and her two young children near the pier. Offset this with Director Gordon numerous penis jokes, and incoherent story-line, and you'll both laugh and scratch your head. Farce and self-mockery don't mix, mainly because they are redundant. \"Baywatch\" is stupid, funny. More often it is stupid, stupid. There is one sequence where Johnson fights the bad guy with baby toys. Yeah. The Rock is the coolest action star, so this makes absolutely no sense. Johnson is at his movie star best as Mitch\u2014charming, bright, and swag. He and Efron have the very cool screen partnership and bromance. When Efron's Brody arrives at Baywatch he expects his entitled pass to lifeguard, because of his Olympic Gold. Mitch and second-in-command Stephanie played by gorgeous and under leveraged Ilfenesh Hadera, tell him, \"We don't give a f***!\" Brody predictably lets Mitch down. In the nice scene Mitch tells Brody, \"I watched you win your 2 gold medals in the Olympics. It was amazing\u0085\" But Brody did that alone. He is part of a team now. He enlightens Brody that he is a selfish jerk. Mitch sees greatness in Brody; he needs to grow up. Shannon and Swift's script fails miserably, instead opting for the ridiculous story-line about evil femme fatale Victoria, played by exasperating Priyanka Chopra, and her drug trafficking scheme of the meth-like designer drug in hopes of owning all real estate in Emerald Bay. However, not at all threatening, Victoria lands as extremely annoying, more the effect of the writing. Instead of more charm of the whimsical Mitch-Brody bromance, we get stupid morgue jokes that extend way too long. In the inadvertent signature moment Brody offers his hysterical misinterpretation of computer networks while Ronnie attempts to hack into the villain's secure server. Ronnie tells Brody, \"It's a good thing you're pretty.\" Pretty alone isn't enough to save \"Baywatch\". There is the spectacular montage as the Baywatch lifeguards all run in classic slow-mo on the beach. Seeing those perfectly sculpted bodies in red Speedos is stunning and the sentimental homage. The actors in \"Baywatch\" are both beautiful and gifted. It's a shame that \"Baywatch\" didn't save them as well."}, {"score": "3/10", "review": "Baywatch is a movie based on the TV show of the same name that ran from 1989 to 1999. It is about a lieutenant of a group of lifeguards called Baywatch, who is played by Dwayne Johnson and he begins picking out three new recruits for the team, one is named Summer, another Ronnie and the last one is named Matt Brody who is played by Zac Efron. Out of all of them, Matt needs a lot of training before becoming an official member of the team, but as he receives his training from the lieutenant, it seems like there is someone causing trouble around the beach and it is up to the team to investigate and stop the trouble before it ruins their beach.Now I've never gotten into the Baywatch TV show, so therefore I just don't care about it. When I brought the movie up with my father, he told me that the TV show was plain stupid, so I kinda knew what I was going into. By two minutes in, I knew exactly what I was getting into. The movie utilizes a lot of slow motion as if they want to make the characters look sexier or something. I didn't find it sexy though, I just found it hilariously corny. I'm not even kidding when I laughed at every slow motion scene in this movie. In fact, I laughed at every cheesy and stupid scene and joke in this movie. Since I knew that the movie was going to be stupid after the first two minutes, I just embraced it and enjoyed the experience while I could.The story was confusing at times, but hey, it was at least coherent most of the time. I know what it was trying to be; an adaptation to the TV show from the 90s. While I can't judge it as an adaptation since I haven't seen the source material, I can say that it lives up to the corniness of the TV show that my father described. There were many dramatic slow motion scenes of the actors, mostly the women, running. The action scenes were okay. They were one of the few tolerable parts of this entire movie. The action and acting in general were fine. Most of the jokes missed, but I found them enjoyable in an ironic way. Even if I did enjoy this ironically, I can't call this a guilty pleasure. I can't say I enjoyed it simply because I laughed at it. This was an incredibly stupid movie that I can only recommend to those who enjoyed the show.3/10"}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "First this movie is a spoof. Funny right off the jump, starts to die off but picks back up at the end. You can see a lot of the jokes coming and the previews give too much away. I don't want to say too much to give anything away. Zac Efferon was the star of the movie and they should've kept with the spoof.It seems like they tried to get serious to set up a part 2. Worth a rental not movie theater."}, {"score": "5/10", "review": "Let's get the obvious out of the way. This is a remake of the '89 to '01 TV series, Baywatch. How does Hollywood remake it's classic TV? First, they take what was a serious show and turn it into a comedy. Then, they throw in a few unnecessary F-bombs. Then they include a lot of sex jokes, some of which are funny and others that are just stupid. They usually include one or two cast members from the original show (Of course it's going to be Hasselhoff and Anderson, who else?) And they throw in a bad guy, or in this movie, a bad girl.And that is how Hollywood does remakes. They did that with Dukes of Hazzard, They did it with Starsky & Hutch, they did it with CHiPs, every remake had the same setup.Set at Emerald bay, Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson) is a lifeguard who takes his job seriously. Backed up by the lovely C.J. Parker (Kelly Rohrbach) and Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario) and a few other co-workers, Mitch is setting up tryouts for the openings to the Baywatch team. While several potential lifeguards are putting an effort into their work, Former Gold Medalist Matt Brody (Zac Efron) is there for his own benefit. He and Mitch are at constant odds, when a series of drug packets, and bodies wind up on the shores of Emerald bay.To be honest, I enjoyed this movie despite not really seeing the original show. I only watched Baywatch once during it's run. I was 7 years old at the time. It wasn't long after the episode ended I walked around with rigor mortis in my shorts that my mom said I shouldn't watch it anymore.I can understand why people hate this movie - It takes it's source material, beloved by many just the way it is and dirties it up with a lot of swearing, unnecessary sex humor and other gross material. Some moments are funny, others make you shake your head.But, I liked it. I'm not saying it's the greatest movie of the summer, because it's not. But it is a fun movie when you don't analyze it too hard. It's a 2-hour trip to the beach where you're going to have fun.Just don't get caught checking out the lifeguards too much."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "I waited for an entire year for this movie to come out, even though I had never seen the TV show.

It's light, slightly offensive (to whoever it can) and sends this wink to the audience. Not like Deadpool completely breaking the 4th wall. In a way that keeps with the summer vibe.Definitely, a summer movie to watch with friends on a hot evening with a glass of Pimms!Lupierz"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "I am forty-six years old and I'll be one of the first decry Hollywood's descent into 'nothing but potty humor' notions of what passes for comedy these days. Also, having been seventeen when the show first aired I can tell you that the gratuitous shots of bouncing breasts in slow motion we're not nearly as prevalent as people remember, in what little I saw of it. That said, I am absolutely dumbfounded by the negative reviews and poor opening of this film! I can't help but wonder what in the world people were expecting. To be fair, I may have watched about five episodes of the TV show when it was on, but my assumption was that the show was about a group of lifeguards getting into situations and capers well outside the purview of a group of lifeguards. For me, this movie was practically perfect at being what it set out to be. It never tried to take itself too seriously, yet was only just campy enough to let the audience know that. I thought everyone performed well in their given roles, the jokes were hilarious and no more excessive than what I would expect the 2017, rated 'R' film version to pull off. At times I even felt like I was in the middle of a seasons long binge on Netflix. This movie did a decent job of making the outlandish 'not-so-mysterious mystery' somewhat believable and I even half-expected a scene near the end with Priyanka Chopra's villain saying, 'And I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling lifeguards and your bigger, stronger Hasselhoff!' Now as a disclaimer, this was the first 'R' rated movie I took my teen-aged son to see so I thought perhaps my laugh meter was ratcheted up, but the theater that was 85% full at 9:20PM on a Sunday night all seemed to be laughing as hard as we were. I think perhaps people were just upset with this film for having not enough naked women and sexual situations, or contrarily didn't want their Baywatchers using foul language and making penis jokes? I don't know. I say go see this movie with zero expectations, let it be what it is, don't be a prude, and you will laugh a lot and have a good time!"}]
