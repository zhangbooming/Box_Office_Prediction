Professional effects, genre like jumps and aerial pirouettes combined with mutant abilities of catching multiple times bullets in the air (a bit overdone in the trailer, not?).

The action scenes are godlike, humor falls into place so perfectly. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is as good as Hugh Jackman for Wolverine, born to play these roles. Steve Trevor and Diana Prince chemistry is so legit that it surpasses major Romantic hits. Nonetheless, its a Superhero Movie!! and boy, it delivers on that front. Every Guy, Woman, Kids..Dammit Everyone needs to Watch this Movie. You will cry happy tears that one the most iconic Superheroes has made its Film Debut with such a Blast. Hats off to Patty Jenkins and co for delivering the Superhero Movie of the year (I am not kidding). Guess what, Marvel Fanboys are already at it, giving this Masterpiece Mediocre reviews. This Movie is not Mediocre, Its not even Good, ITS F'n GREAT!!! Even if you are not a fan of DCEU, you'll be flabbergasted, blown away, Rejoice in this Wonderful adventure of a Wonderful Woman!"}, {"score": "1/10", "review": "So yeah. The film starts off like a bad episode of Xena Warrior Princess with a laughable battle sequence sporting a zillion stupid slowmo shots. Then the actress playing Wonder Woman gives a laughable performance. She can not even pronounce the name of her stupid mentor on her deathbed. And what is up Wonder Woman's strength? In one scene she is punching a tank and in the next she is getting overpowered by a normal human man. And she is ordered around and dragging like a rag doll during battles... and this was sold as a female empowerment movie? Seriously, people are just idiots. A few paid off movie critics calling this a good movie doesn't mean you have to mindlessly follow suit. For Pete's sake, think for yourselves people."}, {"score": "3/10", "review": "Wonder Woman as a film is quite bad. Don't believe the fanboys or feminists who are trying to con you in to thinking otherwise. I think they wanted it to be good so badly that they may be even fooling themselves. While it's not as bad as BvS or Suicide Squad, it's still dreadful in its execution.(spoiler-free) The bad: Almost every line uttered is a clich\u00e9 with bad humor injected at all the wrong times.The movie is full of loud-music, blinding-colors, Zack Snyderesque slow-mo, and it follows Snyder's lead delivering truly cringe-worthy dialogue.The villain is shallow as can be. They try and set it up as some sort of huge twist in terms of who the villain is, but you can see it coming and when it's revealed it packs no punch at all.The plot is as dumb as the other DCEU efforts to date. Most if not all plot devices are shortcuts and are so badly introduced into the story that it honestly takes you out of the movie if you value story over whiz bang effects.Speaking of effects, the CGI is shockingly bad, especially the battle scenes. It's very unnatural, like the \"wire-fu\" or \"Charlie's Angels\" days of defying physics and gravity. Blurry background and shaky cam are the worst.The overall story telling is as stereotypical as it gets. I know it's a period piece but the big bad, the awkward love story and the hyper-feminist overtones all jumble in to one big mess.The attempted balance of humor and darkness fails. It had to be a result of orders from higher ups that wanted to try and inject some Marvel movie type sensibilities. Be a leader, not a follower.Gal Gadot was as bad as expected. SO wooden, she simply can't act.The movie could have cut 30 minutes and no one would have known.The good: Chris Pine. Great acting and overall performance.The first act with life with the Amazons was interesting delivering a nice set up.Forced humor or not, a few jokes did land. Not a great batting average but it was something.Gal Gadot may not be able to act but she is sexy as can be and does deliver believable action.Overall, I didn't like the movie and I doubt anyone but the rabid fanboy/girls will think very highly of this wasted effort of a movie."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Wonder Woman is a film that means to improve society and bring Hope to diversity! It awakes audiences to realizing both gender inequality and racial inequality under- representation such as handsome-Chinese men with our white actresses are long overdue romantic plots. There are so much territory to explore and to improve and to not hinder our domestic actresses and actors' diversity development. The bell strikes for more diversity and it is great!It is really interesting to see this movie and then hear how some say the same lines, and repeating that it somehow copies Captain America 1 and tries to say it's worse by relating it to Thor 2. Take that by a grain of salt as it is not too hard to make multiple similar reviews. I think from the standout performance of Wonder Woman from Batman V Superman, it showed how good her solo film could be. It certainly was proved in this film. There will certainly be moments where the gender dominance be challenged but only by those super edgy, and to be a real man requires the humbleness to accept balance, and respect the others. I am excited about this film, I hope it get's fair reviews and critical opinions, not ones that are just cheerleaders to the Marvel universe and secretly hoping it doesn't get competitors. Who knows how much money is spent by a studio to sway the initial reviews. Movies reviews should be just about the movies. This film looks good! I care fairness of the reviews equally. To be fair, Thor 2 was okay, similar to Man of Steel, and Wonder Woman has a heart on top the action. Regarding feminism and patriarchal system, each should respect the other without either overcompensating and off-setting the balance. The phase Hollywood have to and needs to improve on, is getting handsome Chinese man a powerful lead protagonist in a movie to suitably make Hollywood unbiased diverse. It is unfortunate that there are probably many studios fearing to give hot Chinese man a central character and integrating them into the supposedly diverse interracial circle of Hollywood. It is surprising that Hollywood is not willing to media any sort of romantic drama between Chinese man and our competent white female actresses. It is an insult to us, and to the large white female actresses population, to be barred from further developing culturally and professionally with diversity. After all we're all humans. Wonder Woman is a good long over- due slate to mitigating the big internal cultural barrier established for poor nefarious reasons by studios own by Hollywood and connected to politics. Let Wonder Woman bring hope to this issue. The film has a great sense of Hope endowed in it."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Wow. Just, wow. I can't believe it.

Gal Gadot's charm in the interviews and talk shows does not translate to the big screen. Any woman with a pretty face can recite lines. Her performance was generic at best. The entire plot was shallow, paint-by-numbers, and the jokes were cringeworthy.I really wanted DCEU to succeed, to have another cinematic world in submerge in.

Beware of the Marvel Shrills who hate on everything DC. Go see this movie for yourself. Great action, Drama, humor, and story.

I admit i was having lot of doubts before getting to this movie. First of all, still no review yet on RT only few days before US opening ( always a bad sign). Few users' reviews on the web and they seems to be too good to be REAL. And yesterday i saw few users here saying those good reviews are fake and giving horrific 1 star and rant on the movie ( will get back to this on the latter part), my heart dropped dead. Forgetting all those worries and trying to be neutral as best to see what i am going to get out from this film, i could say i should never saw those evil, brutal 1 star users' \"what to say\". This movie is REALLY REALLY GOOD!!!! Those good reviews are no lie at all. Everyone agrees wonder women was the highlight Of the BVS. This movie elevates that into another level!! The story really give depth to the character, Gal Gadot is really charming as the wonder women. The action sequence was made beautifully and the final act was just WOW that it gave me a chill that i was longing for a superhero film.Inevitably, people do compare this to those Marvel works. For me, Wonder woman is on pal with Ironman 1 & Captain America 2 winder solider. And people have to bear in mind DC is always different from Marvel, that is the reason it make this movie or DC movie so cool. i do enjoy watching Marvel stuffs, they are always entertaining and action packed, but that's all, they are kind of forgettable and lack of depth. Except Ironman 1, CA2 or maybe civil war, i don't really think other Marvels are really that great, some are even not good to me (i.e. Thor, IM3..). DC movie is not afraid of stepping into the dark side of the human heart, it will give u something meaningful to ponder on....WonderWomen's backstory is set on the WW1, the darkest moment for the humanity. it is the path for wonder women to realize who she really is and what she stands for out of knowing human is the one to blame for all the evil and terrible things they are capable of but human is also fond of love and capable of building better world. The story is so compelling.To those people who could rate movie at 1 star. i mean how could you do that just because you don't like it or simply you are fan of Marvel. We really need different kind of movies more than just always one similar formula."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "I got to see this at an early screening and I am extremely happy to announce that I love the movie! Gal Gadot was the perfect cast for Wonder Woman! The action sequences are amazing. A great script and no editing problems (like in Suicide Squad). This is a very well made film. Patty Jenkins did a fantastic job. Chris Pine and Robin Wright are also really good. Wonder Woman is inspiring and people will look up to her for decades because of this film.

There are war scenes that may be too intense for them.I personally loved watching it, and I plan to watch it again for the THIRD time in the cinemas this weekend!"}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Wonder Woman is the latest film in the (up until now) failed DCEU and it seriously kicks some ass. With the 2016 arrivals of Batman V Superman and the atrocious Suicide Squad, expectations were tempered with this film and rightfully so. Batman V Superman may have redeemed itself with a self-indulgent but much needed director's cut and Suicide Squad...well, yeah-that just was terrible so any pessimistic antics regarding this film are sort of justified given the track record thus far. Well, I can say without a doubt in my mind, this is one seriously cool film. Directed by Patty Jenkins and also stars Chris Pine, Danny Huston and Robin Wright, Wonder Woman is the DCEU's Marvel equivalent to Thor and it is just as good, if not, better. First off, the film is very informative even to a layman. It doesn't treat things as common knowledge but it doesn't hold your hand either. This is a smart movie when it comes down to it because it doesn't rush anything. Everything in the film flows naturally, it doesn't feel like these characters are boring or that the story is not engaging. The pacing is very well set and for a film that is pushing 150 minutes, that's impressive. The acting is also surprisingly great. Gal Gadot as Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman is probably the most perfect casting in cinema history. Gadot is fierce, brave and absolutely stunning in her portrayal. It reminded me a lot of Christopher Reeve when he was Superman. The supporting cast lead by Chris Pine is also great. Pine is proving himself to be one great actor. With last year's Hell or High Water and now this, Pine is slowly proving what it means to be a movie star. Another stand out in the film is Danny Huston who seems to relish in villainous roles. Huston is really great here and I'm hoping he gets the credit he deserves. While there is much to praise with this film, there is also so issues I had with it as well. Many people were actually comparing this film to The Dark Knight at my screening. As much as I did like this film, I am also here to say: No. Not even close.The issues I had with the film were more so directed in the way of the script. While I thought the pacing was great in the film, I thought some of the dialog was horrendous and cheesy. The film does escape and shed some of the very things that landed DC in hot water but it also can't seem to escape one very damaging part of DC: bad dialog. While I am sure that many people are not going to care about a misplaced line or two in between Wonder Woman kicking butt and taking names during trench warfare, it does become a bit of distraction during the less exciting moments. The moments between Pine and Gadot are very melodramatic and feel more like a soap opera at times. Many people will like it, I personally thought the cheeky stuff was more so thrown into the film rather than feeling natural.Overall, Wonder Woman is a great addition to the superhero genre. It has heart, it is lighter than other DC films but also has the edge it needed to be a cut above the rest. Fans of Wonder Woman comics should be pleased and tickled pink by this lovely film adaptation and those of you who were skeptical can breathe a sigh if relief because this movie is definitely worth the price of admission."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and even Man of Steel were all critically divisive movies in the growing DC extended universe. After each one came out, fans were hoping the next one would be the movie that would be embraced by all movie going fans alike. Now, that next one is Wonder Woman. Is Wonder Woman going to be the first DCEU film to be overwhelmingly praised? Yeah, I think it will!Wonder Woman stars Fast and the Furious actress Gal Gadot as Diana, the princess of Themiscara, which is a mysterious island of amazons hidden from the outside world. The action starts when Chris Pine's Steve Trevor meets Diana when he crashes his plane near Themiscara and recruits her to help him with the escalating World War.I went into this movie with a lot of reluctance because I love these DC characters and Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and even in some ways Man of Steel disappointed in different ways. I wanted this movie to be the first great DCEU movie and I'm really happy to say that it is!Patty Jenkins directs with grace and wonder. You can tell how much she loves the character of Wonder Woman. Patty Jenkins had said that one of her favorite films growing up was Superman: the Movie from 1978 and you can really tell because there are a few homages to that movie. Wonder Woman is a strong character and this film makes movies like Catwoman and Elektra look like a complete joke. If you mix together the fish-out-of-water element of Thor and place it into the World War setting of Captain America: The First Avenger, then you get a good idea of what this movie is.Much like Chris Hemsworth in the first Thor and Dave Bautista in Guardians of the Galaxy, Gal Gadot is limited in the amount of dramatic acting she has to do and is instead given the chance to show her surprisingly decent comedic chops to hide her unseasoned acting ability. The beauty comes from when Gadot really needs to get serious in some key scenes, she brings it and she's pretty commendable. Add on her great physicality and look and Gadot is actually pretty damn good in the role!Her Chemistry with Chris Pine is one of the highlights of the movie and may be one of the reasons Gadot is as good as she is. There are several scenes where his performance is just laugh out loud funny. In particular, a scene with both Pine and Gadot on a boat had me howling for more.At the end of the day, while I wouldn't say that Wonder Woman is one of the best comic book movies ever made by any stretch of the imagination. I would, however, say that it is a very good installment and that it is the best DC movie since 2008's The Dark Knight!4/5"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Wonder Woman was indeed a wonder to watch.

This movie blew me away. Gal Gadot has officially won me over, I remember when they first cast her and I was a little skeptical because not only was she skinny, but she didn't really have any major acting roles other than being in a couple Fast and Furious movies. But, she bulked up and really took this role seriously. Chris Pine was also amazing as well. I just can't seem to find anything negative about this movie."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "This movie is Awesome. It has a little bit of everything. Action, comedy, and romance.

Let me just get this out of the way. I love both Marvel and DC. I want them all to be good, but if I'm being honest, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad are complete misfires. They're both messy, mishandled, with a lot of corporate meddling. However, Wonder Woman is the complete opposite. This marks a second great DC film for WB in my books(I know there are people who love/hate Man of Steel, but I happened to really like it). Princess Diana, otherwise known as Wonder Woman here is fully realized and completely three-dimensional. She finally gets her due in cinema and I cannot be more pleased. She's idealistic yet naive, compassionate, yet stubborn, and brave. I typically dislike origin stories, but every now and then they can be very fun, and Wonder Woman is that exception. Patty Jenkins who led Charlize Theron to an Oscar, brings a story that is packed with heart without ever getting too over the top or too heavy handed. During the hype train I disliked the idea of Gal Gadot, mainly due to her inexperience as an actor. She slightly won me over for the short amount of time she was in Batman v Superman, but now she really won me over. I will admit, there are moments where she didn't exactly deliver her lines effectively, but I think the more she plays this character the more better she'll be. Chris Pine is great in the role of Steve Trevor. Again, while I thought some of Gadot's delivery felt dry or cheesy, she and Pine do have a great chemistry. I always preach about this, and even if it sounds like overkill at this point, but chemistry is so important with anything that has to do with romance. The romance here is solid and believable. In a very good way it was very reminiscent of Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter. The supporting cast are solid, highlights include Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright portray Queen Hippolyta and General Antiope, and they're not characters who get the short end of the stick, they actually contribute to Diana's upbringing. The supporting cast is good too. Pine's Trevor recruits a ragtag team, again reminiscent of The Howling Commandos in Captain America: The First Avenger. Taking a page off Marvel though, the villains are the ones who do end up getting the short end of the stick. There is a twist I didn't see coming, but even then it was a bit excessive and kind of out of place. I will say though, I happened to enjoy only Elena Anaya's creepy Doctor Poison out of the film's villains. The third act is slightly underwhelming, but the action scenes are fantastic. I was quite surprised as I was concerned about Patty Jenkins' ability to shoot action. Also they're lit in daylight and being able to see everything unfold is just pure eye-candy. Something I appreciated is that Jenkins also shows the casualty of what war brings and she doesn't compromise on the gruesome reality of it. Visual effects are good, but there are few moments where its so obvious that it's cgi. I'm not very picky in that department, but when it's too too noticeable, then it automatically takes me out of the film.I did mention Captain America: The First Avenger multiple times, and the film takes some influences and operates like it, but it's not a carbon copy at all. On the surface Wonder Woman might appear to be of similar adventures and superhero films that we've seen on screen, but it's moving parts and the little things it does that makes the film shine. With good character moments, humorous banter, and a resonating romance, it is the female superhero film that we needed. 8.5/10"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "This movie is fantastic and super, crossed expected action of beautiful Gal Gadot.

The action is amazing, the shots were beautifully shot and directed. The highlight of the film is of course Gal Gadot and Chris Pines who both owned the roles of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor. Even the supporting cast provided some great humor and depth, it really made me care about each characters.The only gripe I had was there was some disappointment with the antagonist. The antagonist is not bad in anyway, in fact the antagonist is visually cool looking, but I realize that the antagonist is not the best villain, good but just disappointed.All in all, it is easily one of the best blockbuster films this year, had an amazing time.
