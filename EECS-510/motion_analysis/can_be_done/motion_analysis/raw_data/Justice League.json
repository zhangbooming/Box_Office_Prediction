But all those trailer, and the \"hype\" had me going. Turns out, it was very big disappointment. I don't know how to even start. If they want to make a movie, let it go how comics say. Because of their only hit \"Wonder Woman\", they made her the wisest, strongest, dominant character ever. It felt like more Wonder woman ft justice league than Justice league. It felt like Batman, superman and all other characters were there at the mercy of wonder woman. The way batman acts, superman acts (in comics), over here, it was all just about wonder woman. I know wonder woman is inspiring this and that, but they over did it here. I can't even take it out from my mind how bad it felt I don't think so we are ever gonna see bad-ass batman EVERY AGAIN. It's all about wonder woman now. Secondly, CGI wasn't gonna enough. Story was very predictable, nothing special, no surprises. And the Superman, wasn't exciting, somehow you already know what was gonna happen. It all just felt awful, I wanted to see bad-ass \"batman\", meaning of hope \"Superman\", the king aqua man, inspiring wonder woman etc. But this is more like, we beg you wonder woman for your mercy, please guide us, we are nothing without you, all that crap. I'm not hating on wonder woman (comics), but this is really awful. See there are many plot holes, but it would have been exciting if they did like comics, instead making it all about wonder woman because she had such a hit in DCEU. Gal Gadot is to DC like RDJ to Marvel. Just the difference is RDJ helps all other actors in MCU to rise with him, Gal Gadot makes it all about her, her and HER. After watching this, I even started hating \"Wonder Woman\" movie. Sorry DC"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Seen Justice League at a fab screening today and was so worried about it being a pure comic book movie fan and a fan of these characters. I'm not a crazy Marvel or DC fan I have always been a fan of both universes in film and comics. But since Man of Steel had such a bad reaction or should I say mixed reaction I've felt it being hard to win people over with this new version of DC movies. Man of Steel ended being in my top 10 superhero movies of all time and this is coming from a person who isn't a fan of Superman. But not everyone agrees with the movie so then comes Batman v Superman which I thought was subpar not a great movie but still has parts I can appreciate and suicide squad which I loved upon first viewing but then started to see its flaws after a second time and understand why people hate it. But going into Justice League I was kind of scared because Wonder Woman was so great I didn't want them to backtrack and I have to say they did not. This movie is great sure it has plot problems and a villain who is totally forgettable and says mother a lot you'll see what I mean when you see the movie since he is referencing something but this movie has such a great vibe. It's about hope and these new age of hero's and I think it took the right step for the DC characters since a lot of the complaints was that it was too dark. Without giving to much away with plot basically steppenwolf comes after 3 things on earth and Batman and Wonder Woman have to recruit the team in order to stop him. And one of the best parts of this movie is the characters and the way they interact with each other. Flash and Wonder Woman where the stand outs, Batman was great as always, cyborg was spot on and aquaman brought all The comedy. Overall I'm happy to say the movie was great. If I was to rank it in favorite DCEU movies so far it would be. 1. Man of Steel 2. Wonder Woman 3. Justice League Oh yeah Danny Elfmans score is great when you hear the Batman and the Superman theme the audience will probably clap loud. Pros: Characters, script, score. Cons: villain, a few plot holes, needed to be longerAlso the 2 post credit scenes are awesome the first one is fun the second one reminded me of the iron man post credit scene but very Anti you'll see what I mean lol don't wanna spoil it but overall I had a smile on my face the entire time after I left the theater. I wish I can explain more in detail but there are so many spoilers in this movie most of the trailer didn't even show everything something's was misdirection and some things aren't even in the movie that was in the trailer. And some characters don't get much screen time. But like I said it's a great movie. I'm hoping it gets a rating that it deserves because sometimes I think people are overly critical about these movies.

When going forward with the fifth film (the all-important one that ties everything together and launches it into the stratosphere), do you stick with what you know? Or do you try to learn from the outpouring of love and acclaim that greeted Wonder Woman, the outlying fourth film? Do you add more humour and a dash of fun to the generally dark, dour proceedings? Do you refine your script to focus a little more on character and less on bombastic spectacle? In the case of Justice League, the answers \u2013 and corresponding results \u2013 are mixed. (Kinda, kinda, yes, kinda, by the way.) Justice League opens in the wake of Superman's (Cavill) death. The world \u2013 and his erstwhile frenemy Bruce Wayne/Batman (Affleck) \u2013 are in a dark depression. But cataclysmic sieges on a planetary scale wait for no man (or woman). Steppenwolf (played by Hinds via motion-capture), an ancient, alien evil that once tried to claim Earth as his own, has returned with an army of fear-fuelled parademons. Bruce realises that, without Superman as the first and best line of defense, he needs to assemble a team (a 'justice league', as it were) to save the world.Consequently, the first half of the film is rather exposition-heavy, as it busily sets up its characters, relationships and stakes. Bruce reunites with Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gadot), just as she's begun to step out from beneath the shadow of grief. We also get to know the other potential League members that we've only glimpsed in passing \u2013 snarky speedster Barry Allen/Flash (Miller); sassy fish-whisperer Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Momoa); and surly human machine Victor Stone/Cyborg (Fisher).Thankfully, Justice League isn't as relentlessly dark and joy-free as director Zack Snyder's previous entries in the DCEU. While there's nothing wrong with going full grim when putting superheroes on screen (Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy proved that you could do so with depth, flair and intelligence to burn), Snyder's Man Of Steel and Batman Vs. Superman were curiously bleak pictures. Stuffed with bombastic spectacle and testosterone- charged face-offs, both films were more or less dreadful, displaying a fundamental misunderstanding of their main characters. (Cavill's broody Superman, in particular, is a painfully misguided interpretation of DC Comics' most iconic superhero, a literal and figurative beacon of light.) In contrast, there's a brighter vein of hope and humour threaded throughout Justice League, though it's unclear just how much of that can be credited directly to Snyder. The main reason for that is the involvement of Joss Whedon, who wrote and directed Marvel's two enormously successful and largely acclaimed Avengers films. Initially brought on to doctor the script, Whedon wound up overseeing post- production on the film (including significant reshoots), after Snyder chose to take some time off for very sad personal reasons.Without question, the final film benefits from the injection of Whedon's signature banter and his ability to effectively juggle multiple character narratives. Whether it's Barry and Victor bonding in a graveyard or Arthur's big speech before the final battle, Whedon contributes some of the most purely fun \u2013 and funny \u2013 moments in the DCEU to date.Characters and relationships, though more sketched than fleshed out, work well enough. As the film progresses, each member of the fledgling League works out who they want to be, as people and as the earth's self-appointed defenders. The newcomers are all decent, though not quite the breakout successes the studio is no doubt hoping for. Miller's Flash starts out adorable but ends up annoying. Momoa is underserved by the script, but nails the swagger. With just half his face to work with, Fisher amps up the angst while buried beneath some oddly ugly character design.As for DC's Big Three, it can be tough to buy into Diana's decades-long descent into grief following the character-defining climax of Wonder Woman. But, given that her arc is necessarily dictated by earlier narrative decisions, Gadot finds some lovely emotional beats to play as Diana chooses to lead and share her light with the world. The film also nudges the hitherto badly-botched relationship between the late Superman and Lois Lane (Amy Adams, still criminally underused) in a better direction.The biggest surprise of Justice League is how Affleck's Batman \u2013 almost rabidly xenophobic in Batman Vs. Superman \u2013 grounds both the film and the team. There's something hauntingly poetic about watching this taciturn loner, who could so easily hide himself away in a fortress of wealth and power, trying to atone for the world's loss of Superman. Embracing the fact that he's by far the most mortal member of the League, the film finds the heroism in Batman's humanity.For all that it gets right, though, Justice League suffers for being what it largely still is: a Snyder blockbuster. He tends to favour overblown spectacle and one-dimensional villains, both of which culminate in the peculiarly unmenacing Steppenwolf \u2013 a CGI-drenched creation that manages to be hammy and fake all at once. The plot is, somehow, stupidly convoluted and insultingly simple at the same time. ('Mother Boxes' must be another way of spelling 'MacGuffin'.) And, while absolutely everything about this film is better than what Snyder has produced before, it still never quite grabs the heart.Nonetheless, Justice League is a step in the right direction. It doesn't reach the glorious heights of Wonder Woman, but it doesn't regress to the murky depths of Batman Vs. Superman either. With its story and characters turned firmly towards the light, there might be hope for this franchise yet."}, {"score": "3/10", "review": "Absolutely disappointed, the movie lacked any depth and felt like a sequence of scenes designed solely to set up to future stand alone movies for the so called heroes from Justice league.

Now, after 10 years in development, we finally got the movie and it doesn't disappoint.The founding members are Batman, Wonder Woman and joining them are Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg - it's such a disappointment that fan favourite Superman (last played by Henry Cavil) is dead. JL includes two post credit scenes and both are equally great, can't spoil them. What I disliked about the movie?There are some cut scenes which end abruptly. This might be due to keep-it-under-two-hours thing. Most of the sequences from trailers are cut from the movie. In the tunnel sequence when batman brings his night-crawler he says \"My turn' in the trailer and in the movie it's just another stupid joke he makes. I don't understand why Batman has suddenly become a comic character. In another scene halfway the movie batman makes a joke about something bleeding which was totally not Batman like. If someone else made that joke I could understand but this is the Goddammn Batman we are talking. He just doesn't bleed and yell.I really hated the Wonder Woman and Flash sequence where he falls on her boobs. I will not talk about those ass shots.For all those shouting bad CGI I didn't notice Henry Cavil's moustache. The CGI was really done. I was enjoying the movie not looking for a frame to yell 'hey look bad CGI'. Honestly I noticed it only in beginning phone recording sequence (I am sure it was inspired by Homecoming, which is really sad. WB had show little hope that They could have used such cheap shots. They could have allotted this time for more character building.The road to Justice League 2 is very long. I hope it doesn't get cut down too.

Nolan's years at helm are certainly far away by now.The bafflingly conventional, illogical and randomly jumping story doesn't have a single unexpected turn of events and instead treads waters that have been trod many times before and with greater success. The CGI is strangely haphazard, with very little care how it stands out when scenes are edited together. Steppenwolf is an eye-wateringly bad villain, becoming a clumsy scarecrow whose motivations and powers come and go.Actors are an uneven bunch, both as characters and as talents, and fail to generate camaraderie or chemistry. Ezra Miller is so much better as an actor than the rest that he becomes a distraction by reminding us about it constantly. Every time his delivery elevates the poor material, it turns against the movie when the next one who opens his mouth only looks cringe-worthy."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "If Batman V Superman is the oozing, puss-filled, body wound to the DCEU than Justice League is the haphazardly applied bandage that's currently dressing it. It works at least as far as mitigating the damage, stopping the bleeding and keeping this ugly-looking spectacle alive, but it's not exactly the miracle cure for the mountains of ills currently plaguing the DCEU that fans were hoping for. What exactly does that make Suicide Squad; I don't know, probably the gangrene? Seemingly only a couple of weeks since the death of Superman, Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince aka Batman and Wonder Woman preemptively team-up to protect the world from external threat. To help them, they recruit young upstarts Barry Allen and Victor Stone aka The Flash and Cyborg; as well as marine demigod Arthur Curry aka Aquaman. This is so they can face down the eventual threat of the sinister Steppenwolf and his army of fear-fueled creatures from places unknown aka some inter-dimensional/space traveling hypno-beam (the film is not clear on this point).Starting with the good, the films as-of-yet introduced superheroes are interesting enough characters handled with the best of care by their actors. Miller especially does an excellent job keeping the mirth coming while staying true to the spirit and tone of The Flash and movie respectively. Momoa straight up shows up as Momoa sans the dreads but the rock star bravado he's known for works and works well all things considered. Fisher pulls double duty as a near constant fountain of exposition as well as a living breathing character worth investing in. It doesn't always work given the paragraphs worth of beans he needs to spill but at least no one is calling him the professor yet.The brightest star however is Gadot whose stunning beauty and otherworldly accent perfectly encapsulates every superficial thing we love about Wonder Woman. On a deeper level, Diana's naivet\u00e9 from the fondly revered Wonder Woman movie is gone, but what's still there is an inner strength that both serves to ground this movie, while being an understandable progression of a character now centuries old.The fact that Wonder Woman is the only character worth not just caring for but believing in should be an indication of what's the biggest problem with this movie. Even with the Batman in the mix, the stitched-together cadre feels less like the world's mightiest heroes and more like a League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. They're given just enough time to go over their skill set and motivations but its all bullet points and untrimmed fat that at times derails the film's pacing. Take a scene transition early on where Bruce Wayne is buttering up Aquaman. This scene is then set against Wonder Woman's action-packed introduction, an edit that arguably works on a narrative level but feels jammed in there like a Janis Joplin tune played just after a cover of \"Come Together\".What's worse, Justice League always seems to be in a rush to get somewhere guaranteeing moments of depth and exposition stick out harshly against the action. Bruce Wayne jets here and there, Steppenwolf picks a fight with the Amazons and the Atlantians, Wonder Woman comes swooping through a terrorist plot etc. It's all action-packed in its own bruising, unremarkable way, but none of it is good at conveying information, establishing stakes or forwarding the plot.Luckily the plot is so simple as to ensure the slow bits are over quickly. Evil-because-he's-evil Steppenwolf wants all the shiny cubes and our protagonists are doing everything in their power to stop him. That's basically it, a first draft good versus evil macguffin hunt that seems to be avoiding themes from the other films until a certain subplot makes it impossible. It doesn't add anything to the genre that they're fighting the third DC villain in five movies with a horned helmet on some power trip about world destruction but at least it makes sense this time around.And before you go huffing and puffing about how the complex mythology behind Superman, Darkseid and the infinite Earth crisis is justification for the repetitiveness; you need to first read the forthcoming sentence aloud and slowly. Movies do not require homework! Knowing the larger purpose and machinations of a motherbox is no more an indication of this movies quality than reading The Dark Knight Returns retroactively makes BvS not a pile of garbage. Enough makes sense this time around but it's still repetitive.And can we take a moment to talk about Batfleck again? I was very loudly not a fan of his older, reactionary Batman in BvS but since that movie was such a dumpster fire, I was willing to give everyone involved a mulligan so long as this one was at least passable. It is, but the poor man still looks like a bewildered stepfather who won the part in a raffle and continues wearing the cowl because his stepson finally thinks he's cool. It's just not a good use of your Affleck. Affleck is good for two things: being an a**hole and being a quiet blank slate a la his character in Argo. Batman is neither of those things but thanks to Affleck he comes across as both. Not something you want for the founder of the Justice League.A reported $25 million worth of reshoots, the unexpected absence of director Zack Snyder due to personal reasons and a shaky foundation built upon the most hated franchise movie to come out since Batman & Robin; it's actually kind of impressive this thing didn't turn out worse. It's not up to the level of another team-up movie that shall remain nameless but at least with Justice League, DC and Warner Bros. prove they're slowly learning from their mistakes. I admire this movie, I really do, but to the extent that I'd admire a fat guy running a marathon. It's trying; it's just too ill-prepared and bloated to do the job efficiently."}, {"score": "5/10", "review": "After years of speculation and uncertainty, DC Films' answer to Marvel's Avengers is finally here. But is it necessary? Fans, movie pundits, studio suits and everyone else in between can argue over this for years. The answer is irrelevant, and given the outcome, even rhetorical. As awkward as it sounds, Justice League - with no less than five latex clad superheroes - is the finale to director Zack Snyder's trilogy (following Man of Steel and Batman Versus Superman) but also distances itself from the previous two by trying to fix common complaints about those films - too dark and no spunk, we said. Well guess what; The makers behind Justice League heard our protests and made this film as bright as day. There's also some humour that will draw a genuine smirk from all but the sternest viewer or harshest critic. That's it. Everything else is an incoherent, incomplete, unguided, unwanted mess. The problems are plenty because that mess is all over the place. On one level, the world is still mourning the death of Superman. Like the previous film, Biblical analogies are apparent, but only if you care to look below the surface and only if you know what to look for; which is why a genuine question in this film is whether or not a God can be resurrected, and if so, should that happen. Then the tone shifts to familiar territory. On another level, the planet is about to be destroyed by Steppenwolf (played by Ciar\u00e1n Hinds by bizarrely imitating Liam Neeson), an alien general done up with bad CGI. And then there is Bruce Wayne who claims his superhero ability is being rich. If that isn't a stab at Tony Stark, is it meant to be funny? After hobbling along with these one-liners for an hour, the titular roster is setup for the first and bombastic clash of superpowers. But by this time we are essentially watching two movies, and it won't take long before it dawns on the viewer that something isn't quite right. Or not altogether there. Even as alarming as that sounds, there is yet another movie which struggles to break through the superficial cracks of the main movie, and this is probably why Justice League is almost forgivable - The idea of a team of misfits trying to fit, (which made The Avengers hugely entertaining) seems to find some footing in this film too. Ezra Miller's Barry Allen, AKA The Flash, holds a candle to Tom Holland's Peter Parker. For better or worse, Miller even has a lot more pep than Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne and Batman combined! Another welcome addition is Jason Momoa as the brooding Aquaman, and although there's something fishy about his supersonic speed, there's not much else explored.When it works, it's because of the camaraderie between some of the characters. Along with Miller's Flash, Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is almost always one of them. Consistency, though, is not a strong point in this film. In the end, and despite being salvageable, Justice League is content with breeding familiarity. This includes a villain that is both weak and boring, and with an agenda that we have seen one too many times. As for Ray Fisher's Cyborg, there's little doubt that anyone will remember how and why he is a member of the League. While all this is still forgivable given Snyder's tragic personal loss during filming, the biggest undoing is a superhero film unsure of what it wants to be. Which again asks \u2013 was this necessary?"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "I originally had some doubts about this movie, but they were soon blown away. Action is great, story is nothing new or exciting but it works. The villain is OK...definitely the worst part of the movie. The heroes shine, performances are all great, the interactions between the heroes are great."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "As both a Marvel and Dc fan, this movie exceed all of expectations. Such a great hype and action packed film. I loved every single character and how well they developed together. I would see this movie 10 more times!! The only flaws I saw with the movie was some CGI but hey. Not every movie is perfect, the visuals were amazing and was just a epic movie to sit and watch and bring to life finally."}]
