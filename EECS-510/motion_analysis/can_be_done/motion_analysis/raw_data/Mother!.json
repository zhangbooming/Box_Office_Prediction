The disappointing aspect of this film is that Jennifer Lawrence somehow  portrays an ego that is beyond the character. It's a kind of \"you know  that I know I'm only acting this and the real movie is me\" that seems  to have perpetuated in every film she had made since Silver linings  Playbook, bar X-Men (when she was covered in paint and having to \"live  in\" the previous \"humble\" shoes of Rebecca Romijn) and American Hustle  (where she was greedy White Trash).  She needs a director who can \"humble her down\", in the same way  Eastwood did for Jolie in Changeling, so that her ego is less of a  distraction for her acting."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "I attended the premiere screening of 'mother!' and the entire audience left the cinema speechless. Potentially Aronofsky's magnum opus, 'mother!' benefits from rich religious and environmental symbolism with so much more bubbling under the surface than the majority of mainstream cinema today.With a genius marketing plan - the film itself is shrouded in secrecy, with intriguing trailers which actually give away nothing - 'mother!' exceeds expectations and takes turn after turn, each more shocking and tantalising than the next.Aronofksy prefaced the screening with an apology for what we were about to witness, but that we will \"feel better tomorrow\", while Jennifer Lawrence noted its biblical and environmental themes. That doesn't give away anything, though. It's almost impossible to describe it - go and see for yourself -- but give yourself some time after to decompress.Lots of discussion will emerge after this film's release, and that's a good thing. It's esoteric but not alienating, and covers such a wide scope of themes that everyone will pick up something different. I found the film to be feminist in nature, and a brilliant comment on a woman's societal role in the modern era.Though the acting is top-notch, the film's overall message makes 'mother!' a winner. The sheer pathos of the film overrides it's slightly clunky dialogue, and Aronofsky's assured direction will set this film to be the most-discussed movie of 2017."}, {"score": "1/10", "review": "This movie is terrible, I was excited to get to see it before the wide release.

Joy was about as Joyless as one can get. Passengers was pretty boring. Anyway, this flick is another critic darling from the plagiaristic mind of Darren Aronofsky. Black Swan stole a lot from Requiem of a Dream. Lawrence is too young to play Javier Bardem's wife. She is. He's 48 and she's like 25. And, let's remember, Jennifer only got the job because she's Aronofsky's girlfriend. Natalie Portmann did a great job in Black Swan, but Jennifer is her usual overacting self in this poorly-made sludge of CGI-infested garbage. The CGI looks fake. Even Aronofsky said Lawrence was pretty bland in rehearsals. See Wikipedia if you don't believe me.Michelle Pfeiffer, given little to do, steals the show as the house guest showing you exactly what a movie star looks like. The movie really needed a gifted actress like Portmann to pull it off. Jennifer just doesn't have the acting chops to make it all real during the movie. She looks confused, out of her element and, at times, disinterested. Even Roger Ebert said this wasn't Lawrence's finest hour.And, God, is this film BORING! Aronofsky's constant close-ups of Lawrence, showing off his girlfriend maybe?, does the viewer no favors since Lawrence is best being Jennifer not delving deep into a role like Michelle Pfeiffer or Natalie Portman. Let's face it, Lawrence stole her Oscar for Silver Linings Playbook. She was basically herself with Bipolar things in her life. Bradley Cooper, on the other hand, nailed it.If you are expecting great things like Black Swan, you won't get them with this flick.

But I will say this; This film is unlike anything else out there. It is not a remake of Rosemary's Baby despite all the vibes.

It's a slow burn that explodes in the end with something beyond any normal functioning minds.Jennifer Lawrence is a raw talent that we are blessed with. Michelle Pfeiffer is golden at doing what she does best; being creepy and daunting. Ed Harris is the only character here aside from Jennifer's that you feel any form of sympathy for.This film is shining with relevancy to the world we live in now, full of selfishness, narcissism, greed and the consequence of too much freedom.Please I urge you to watch this in a cinema or the biggest screen possible with the best sound.

I thought Requiem for a Dream was a near-perfect film, one of my all-time favorites, 10 out of 10 on my list. The Wrestler and Pi were both very, very good, 9 out of 10's. And I liked Black Swan as well, 8 out of 10. The Fountain, I'm sure I just didn't understand it, I couldn't even finish it. And Noah was complete dogsh1t, if you want to know how I really feel. So where would I rank \"Mother!\" you ask? I'd put it in the Wrestler/Pi category, a strong 9 out of 10...this is a really good flick! It doesn't quite reach the heights (or lows, shall we say) of Requiem, few movies can, but this is one nice piece of art in its own right. It makes you feel so uncomfortable at times, you want to leave the room, but at the same time, you can't look away. This is a rare gem. The similarities to Rosemary's Baby is obvious, you could almost say it is a love letter or a sequel to the 1968 flick. I'm not sure I completely understood all of the imagery and what was either religious or supernatural overtones, so I already can't wait to re-watch it a few times at home. The ending has a nice twist to it as well. Highly recommended to those who love good film.By the way...Intentional or not, \"Mother!\" has a lot of similarities to the song of the same name by Danzig, at least that's what I read into it. (The song is never played or mentioned in the movie, nor would it even fit.) Watch the movie then read the lyrics though...it's wild to see some of the lines and how they match up with the movie. Almost makes you wonder if this song was used as some of Aronofsky's inspiration for the movie.Great movie!...9 out of 10.JD(IMDB: please bring back the message boards!!)"}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Greetings again from the darkness. Him. Mother. Man. Woman. When those are the identifiers of the four main characters (none have a real name), one might assume that the filmmaker is lazy. However, after watching the latest from the psycho-creative force known as Darren Aronofsky, we understand that names weren't necessary, and even if they had been, he was probably too mentally exhausted from finding ways to torture those characters and confound the viewers. The first half of the film is discomforting and creepy while the second half is downright crazed and deranged. You won't find many story details in this review, as the fun is in the shock. Most of the film is through the eyes of Jennifer Lawrence, and we share her confusion and disoriented state. She is married to a famous poet played by Javier Bardem (yes, the age difference is acknowledged). While she spends her days refurbishing their stunning country home, he battles severe writer's block. Needless to say, their domestic bliss goes wrong \u0085 but it's not the kind of wrong we've ever seen before. Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique (both Oscar nominees) confine us in excruciatingly tight shots resulting in further disorientation and claustrophobia through most of the film. By the time we get a single wide shot of the home's exterior, we've just about given up hope. And once Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer show up, we kick into full ROSEMARY'S BABY mode \u0085 only more frenetic and hyper.It should be noted that it's not a traditional horror film \u2013 heck, it's hardly a traditional film at all. It's built on confusion, and metaphors abound. Aronofsky seems intent on causing endless post- viewing discussions and debate over what it \"means\". A case can be made for commentary on ego, fame, Mother Nature, deity/religion, and a sign of the times \u2013 the entitled \"takers\" of the world. The most obvious explanation is that the price paid for creativity is quite dear, and often causes a release from reality. There is a vicious cycle occurring here and our realization happens after the crescendo of insanity that is the film's peak.WTF moments are too many to count, and Ms. Lawrence pulls off what has to be the roughest on screen pregnancy we've seen. It's a real treat to see Michelle Pfeiffer back in form after being out of the spotlight for four years. The score from Johan Johannsson is remarkable and there are ground-breaking visual effects (easy to miss during the audacious, frenzied second half action). Aronofsky is clearly provoking us, though it's abundantly unclear to what end. His previous twisted, mind- benders include REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and BLACK SWAN \u0085 both of which seem like mainstream family fare in comparison. This is a love it or hate it project, and most will likely fall into the latter. But for those who embrace the deranged and audacious, the love will be everlasting."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "In an age frequently dominated by generic and banal movies, it is refreshing to see that such good filmmaking still exists. Darren Aronofsky's \"Mother!\" is not only the best film of the year, but it is also a timeless piece of art that will still be just as relevant for generations to come. \"Mother!\" is, at its core, a film about the endless generosity of nature taken advantage of by mankind. This film is packed with so much symbolism and so many layers of meaning that one couldn't possible begin to dissect it all in one viewing. The unorthodox style and brutal honesty of the film may turn some viewers off, but this is a very important narrative that we must not shy away from. Aronofsky is well aware of the fact that history repeats itself, and unless humans decide to take responsibility for our actions and stop the endless assault on Mother Nature, we might wake up one day to find that she has no more love to give.

Its a star studded cast with an incredible director and creative team behind it, but this show honestly sucked. It started out as a snooze fest. The cinematography was excellent and there were some creative shots, but for the most part it was pretty boring. And then came the house guests. Oh boy. The whole story line was just obnoxious. I hated every character. You have Michelle Phiffer who is a horrible human, Ed Harris who is off his rocker, and Jennifer Lawrence who plays the submissive housewife who takes all of their crap. She doesn't stand up for herself or to her husband and it drove me NUTS. I wanted to put my arms through the screen and shake Jennifer Lawrence the whole time and tell her to stand up for herself! After the house guests leave the story became absolutely crazy. Not crazy in a good way. Crazy in a \"why am I sitting here watching this film\" way. While I understood the film in the end, there was absolutely nothing redeeming or entertaining about this story line to me. About midway through the movie I turned to my friend and said \"maybe we should just leave\", but we decided to stay and I truly regret that decision. The last half of the movie was utter chaos with no light at the end of the tunnel. I felt this entire movie had no sense of direction. The ending was artsy, but totally bazaar and there was truly not a single moment of this film that I enjoyed. I didn't give it a 1/10 because of the cinematography and creativity, but if it weren't for those things this would have gotten a 1. I HATED it.

I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it. It is really nice to see directors like Darren Aronofsky take chances like this. What you get in mother! is one part drama one part horror six parts insanity. The story does not take any time at all to get going, it becomes completely crazy about an hour in and the final 20 minutes will leave you shocked. While I was not totally floored by either main stars performance the acting was surely great. The problem with mother! is, taken at face value it's totally ridiculous. The things that end up transpiring are absurd and over the top to say the least. Therefore mother! will surely be a polarizing movie. As a small example I went with 3 other people to see it, including myself it was a 50/50 love hate outcome. As far as the shocking moments in the film, they are a real doozy. There's one scene in particular that will certainly repel some people. In my theater of about 20 or so people a woman basically ran out during this part. When we left she was waiting outside visibly shaken and yelling at her boyfriend. For me as a person who loves it when films push the envelope and cross boundaries, I was delighted by it all. While mother! is the most audacious original movie of 2017 taken at face value it could be a real bust for some people. After reading into the meaning of the film I'd say I like it even more.

Probably the worst movie I have seen in about 10 years."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "\"Mother!\" follows a couple (Lawrence and Bardem) who live in solitude in an expansive farmhouse that the wife has painstakingly restored from a fire. One evening, they are visited by a doctor (Ed Harris), whose wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) follows. The dynamics of the home are turned upside down, and chaos ensues.I won't attempt to give a full plot summary here, as it's truly a waste of time. If the cryptic promotional materials and slim premise are enough to intrigue (as they did myself), then give the film a go. The first half of \"Mother!\" is just shy of brilliance, with bizarre character interactions, wry humor, and phenomenal performances from all involved. At times, the dynamics between Lawrence, Bardem, Harris, and Pfeiffer give one the sense that they're watching a zany stage play, and the actors (especially Pfeiffer and Harris) clearly have a ball with this. As the film progresses into its second half, it shifts and expands in ways that are unabashedly over-the-top, and Aronofsky quite literally pulls the rug out from under his audience. The film is stuffed with metaphors that are clearly Biblical, but there are numerous bents and other influences spilling in, most notably \"Rosemary's Baby,\" which seems to be a prominent influence Aronofsky wears on his sleeve here; that said, \"Mother!\" is a very different film from it. The second act is chaotic and grotesque, and it's effective up to a point, but it brazenly crosses the line that the first act so cleverly toed; and perhaps that's the aim here, but it's not as enthralling as what comes before it. Overall, I found \"Mother!\" at times riveting and consistently well-acted. It moves from being delightfully off-kilter and sinister to fiery pandemonium, the latter of which doesn't have the same consistent pull as the former. It is no less a thoroughly weird and engrossing epic that demands attention, but I personally found the second act to run itself thin. 7/10."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "Mother! is more like Oh Boy! I knew this new one from Darren Aronofsky was going to be a rough one and give it time, that's exactly what you're going to get.Aronofsky is the man behind such spiritual films as \"Noah\" and \"The Fountain\" and psychological thrillers like \"Black Swan\". You'll find both genres here. Jennifer Lawrence plays the wife of a very well-to-do author played by Javier Bardem. If you're wondering if the age difference is mentioned, it is. I mean she looks like a child bride compared to him, it has to. But anyway, these people are secluded in a house some place, and the silence that exists between them is deafening and its not just because the house creaks or because Bardem's writer has a case of writers block. It's between them. And really what starts off this mystery even more is that an orthopedic surgeon played by Ed Harris and his wife played by Michelle Pfeiffer they just show up out of no where thinking the place is a bed and breakfast.Bardem seems cool with them, but we're following this as the Lawrence character completely taken aback that Bardem is being so hospitable or that they are being so abrasively shitty house guests. Part of where I think the marketing for this really gives you the wrong idea is that this is a bizarre dark comedy more than it is a horror movie. The first hour really is having to deal with worse house guests than Bill Murray in \"What About Bob?\"The mystery is fairly engaging though mostly because you do feel what's missing between the Lawrence and Bardem characters and you're wondering if these house guests are filling it or making it worse. At about the hour mark the question really does arise though of whether this movie is trying to say something or if it is something of a vanity project and to that I think the answer is basically both. Aronofsky includes everything from religious and political allegory, the addiction and cost of fame, being in an emotionally abusive relationship, trying to raise children in such a volatile time as this, and there's so much more. It's a lot and the last 45 minutes or so is somewhat effective in the downright brutal and disgusting imagery it shows, while at other times it really is just disgusting and you'll want to leave all together. It's the jumble of things that makes it hard for me to recommend this movie because despite it being called a horror movie, this is more just throw everything at the wall and see what sticks kind of filmmaking.That's not to say I don't admire the commitment, especially from the cast. Lawrence is perfectly confused and horrified while Bardem, Harris, and some of the most haunting work done by Pfeiffer in a while fill everything out really well. But like I said, this is a movie more of ideas than it is horror. Those ideas are portrayed later on in metaphorical form as horror but I doubt it's what most people are going to be expecting and I doubt many others will see much point in wading through Aronofsky's many converging ideas.

On the one hand it takes at least an hour for the film to start getting interesting, and my patience was tested more than once over its protracted two hour running time. Yet on the other hand the film's switch into full blown, boundary pushing craziness in the last half an hour is something that has to be seen to be believed. Whether it's worth trudging through to reach depends on your tolerance for artsy, self-indulgent filmmaking that's intended to frustrate and provoke. What's even more shocking is the knowledge that mother! comes from a major studio, with Paramount staking its brand for a film that's surely going to divide audiences.Jennifer Lawrence stars as the titular mother, a dutiful housewife to her writer husband (played by Javier Bardem). Living together in their countryside mansion, their peaceful bucolic life is disrupted when a stranger enters their home, setting off a chain of events that quickly spirals out of control. To describe anymore of the plot would be difficult as the film is steeped in symbolism and metaphors that are not easily unpacked. The film becomes increasingly unhinged and abstract, and it invites a plethora of interpretations but offers no definitive answers. Is it a self-reflective indictment of the vanity of artists? A metaphor for the callousness of humans? Or just a reflection of Aronofsky's anger at the present state of the world? The oblique narrative will prove frustrating for many, with reactions likely to range from calling it pretentious trash to an artsy masterpiece, and neither would be a wrong assessment. It's a film defined by binary oppositions; it's ugly yet beautiful, frustrating yet exciting, and all undeniable singular in its vision, for better yet for worse.Some will say that the film will not appeal to mainstream tastes. I don't think that's fair because that implies there's something wrong with the audience and not the film itself. But if the intent of art is to provoke and elicit a response from it's audience then mother! succeeds unequivocally. It's an angry film, which it harnesses to stir up and provoke viewers. So take the star rating with a grain of salt, as it's reductive of the film's intent.
