[{"score": "8/10", "review": "Jordan Peele's directorial debut is an exhilarating horror thriller that also manages to spark laughter and comment on social issues. The cinematography, tropes, and soundtrack echo horror, but the film finds abundant moments of comic relief like when a father reassures the main character he isn't racist by claiming, \"I would have voted for Obama for a third term.\" Before the plot delves into a traditional horror frenzy, it mines the horrors of racism. The social commentary plays on audience expectations and results in both humor and suspense. Delivering both on the expectations of the genre and the comedic expectations of a Jordan Peele creation, GET OUT is simply amazing."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "One of the best of the horror/comedy genre. I had pretty high expectations for this movie because of the awesome marketing campaign and intriguing plot. Get Out delivered on all of my expectations Smart, intense, funny, original and wonderfully shot. I will definitely see this again while its in theaters."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "I came into this movie expecting something to be pounding racism as the main theme. I expected it to just be about racism and how certain groups of people want to go back to the days of slavery. It didn't hit racism in a way that was meant to make people feel uncomfortable. The remarks about racism are more common themes and not the point of the movie. I don't Want to spoil the movie, as the overall plot is interesting. Just this movie being primarily about racism would likely keep many away from it. It does have themes involving racism, but that is not the primary objective of the movie as far as I can see.The movie has a slow build, but really picks up around an hour in. The build feels justified at the end. There's a particularly comical character that is scene more and more as the movie goes and steals the show towards the end. The plot twist is particularly interesting as it's not quite what was expected and yet seems like a reasonable twist.Not a fantastic movie, but overall a fun movie going experience. Not excessively gory to prevent people who don't enjoy those parts in movies, but it is R for a reason. Just seems like a good balance that really surprised me that I didn't regret seeing it."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Let me start off by saying this: Get Out is far from a bad film. It is genuinely frightening at times and, dare I say, even genius at some moments. But the film's biggest problem is that it knows it is a step above other horror films and it reeks of self importance. When you take into consideration the political climate in America, Get Out is a film that is hitting at a right time. It is tackling white liberal racism in the upper middle class and it does a very good job at making its point. However, as the film goes on and the scares become more frequent, the film starts feeling cheesy and overwritten even if the performances are truly stunning.Director Jordan Peele makes the most out of his cast. Daniel Kaluuya gives a truly magnificent performance as Chris while Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are utterly horrifying as the Armitages. However, Allison Williams is a weak link and is very dry in her delivery which makes her performance comes off as wooden. She is the weak link and it isn't hard to figure it out especially in her scenes with Kaluuya. The story progresses and Williams' performance is slowly twiddled down which then leaves the glaring issue of the script. While the characters in this film are really layered and relate-able, the story they are in is so overwritten and self indulgent that it is hard to consider this the horror gem many critics and audiences are calling it.The idea of a great horror film is to thrill and scare while making a social commentary. We look back on such films as Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, Friday the 13th (maybe), Halloween...these films have weight to them and you don't know it until it's over. With Get Out, we know this is a film with political undertones, we know it wants us to think this is something more than a horror film. In some regards it is, but in most it is just a horror film that thinks it is more important than it actually is. This takes from what Peele is trying to achieve with directing a horror film. Everything comes off being very tongue-in- cheek instead of being straight horrifying and that is probably the most disappointing factor with Get Out. Instead of sinking these political undertones in the writing, Peele makes them abundantly clear and it ends up taking away from a film that is, otherwise, pretty good.Get Out is a step above your average horror film and features some pretty amazing performances. Despite this, the film suffers from a very weak script that will feel as if you're being hit over the head with political banter rather than having the sh*t scared out of you. Overall, I was pretty disappointed in Get Out but the film does feature some awesome performances and some genuine scares that will be enough to make you wish the film was better."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Get Out is fantastic.When I first saw the trailer for Get Out, I laughed hard. I thought it looked awful because the trailer was so weird and strangely cut. I was wrong.Here's what the movie did well.Get Out is the best movie I've seen so far in 2017. The story follows an African-American man visiting his white girlfriend's house, but there is so much more than just that. The story is incredibly entertaining. The dialogue kept the audience entertained, it was funny, witty, smart, and kept a constant pace. The movie blended horror and comedy perfectly, neither taking center stage. The film has a lot of dark humor which I'm a huge fan of, it worked very well with the setting and tone of the film. The story has twists and turns that are very original and catches the audience off guard. The story has fantastic social commentary, commenting on subtle racism throughout which is very effective. The story keeps the audience on the edge of their seat throughout. When the comedy hits, it hits hard, each joke hit and were well timed. The horror hits hard as well, making the film disturbing and creepy when it needs to be.The technical things in this movie were amazing. The lighting was consistent and gave the film a dark, stylized, and disturbing vibe. The cinematography was fantastic, each shot giving off a certain feeling which helped move along the story. The music that played in this movie helped with the vibe, fitting whatever scene it was in.Most everyone who acted in this movie gave a fantastic performance. Daniel Kaluuya, Bradley Whitford, and LilRel Howery particularly giving great performances. Everyone embodied their characters perfectly and put a lot of effort into making sure their characters were believable.This film was Jordan Peele's directorial debate, if this type of quality holds up in his future films I can see him having a long and successful career in directing. The film is well paced and makes sure to keep the audience on their seat. Peele made sure to get fantastic performances out of his actors and did a great job creating the tone for this movie.Onto the bad, which there aren't a lot.There was, out of the whole movie, one shot I didn't like. There was a shot with fire in frame. The fire didn't look real which took me out of the story for a split second.Caleb Landry Jones's performance was a little over acted. If he acted less like a cartoon character it would have been better but it doesn't effect the movie in a major way.Overall, Jordan Pelle's Get Out is fantastic,keeping the audience on the edge of their seat when they need to be and made them laugh when the jokes hit. The film is beautiful looking and the story is unique and will surprise many audience members. I highly recommend Get Out if your looking for a quality horror/comedy movie."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "OVERVIEW: Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) is invited by his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) to spend the weekend at her parents estate. This will be the first time Chris has met them and is nervous how their interracial relationship will be received. Something Rose has not warned her parents of. When they first arrive, Chris takes note that both the maid and groundskeeper for the family are black. However, Rose's father Dean (Bradley Whitford) assures him that there are no racial motivations. Even more odd is her mother Missy (Catherine Keener) who practices hypnosis. Despite Chris' decline for a session, she performs it on him anyways.As the weekend gets underway, the family hosts their yearly party with friends, all of whom are white. Chris is growing uncomfortable as it seems everyone is trying way to hard to seem like they aren't racist. They bring up liking Barack Obama, Tiger woods and even make remarks about his physique. He is surprised to see one black man and attempts to chat with him to ease the awkwardness, but finds the young man to be just as odd as the rest of them. Chris finds comfort in a phone call with his cousin Rod (Lil Rel Howery), who swears something sinister is going on. Both he and his cousin continue to grow in their paranoia as they piece together the strange happenings.THOUGHTS: For this horror film, the scares are subtle tricks played upon the audience. It follows more of a psychological thriller pattern, avoiding unnecessary jump scares or relying on gore to aid its story. There is an unease that follows you throughout the film as you try to dissect each character and what is truly going on. It's full of tension and continually plays with your mind. There is also a wonderfully unsettling visual representation of hypnosis that this film utilizes for when Chris is incapacitated. It was reminiscent of The Twilight Zone and it was an interesting way to show the helplessness one could feel.Not surprising was the amount of great comedic moments in this film. There were much needed moments of levity throughout, most delivered by Lil Rel Howery. Use of humor were at times when it felt natural and it wasn't an attempt to overpower the film or its message. Jordan Peele has found so much success in comedy, which was why so many were shocked to hear he was directing and writing this film. This was a nice way for him to merge his love of horror with what he is best known for.Also worth its own praise is the amazing performance by Daniel Kaluuya. Many will recognize him from his appearance in the Black Mirror episode \"Fifteen Million Merits\". His portrayal of the emotionally scarred Chris was such a well-developed character in a genre that sometimes forgets how to do that.Tackling racial issues in a horror movie seemed to unnerve some people when the trailer initially dropped. It was easy for people to judge it on the surface, especially for a topic that makes some people uncomfortable. Without getting into spoiler territory, not only is the subject of racism addressed, but also the idea of genetically superiority as well as life. The film is not so easy to dissect and is really a fun one to watch."}, {"score": "1/10", "review": "So I will be careful about spoilers.The movie might have been interesting and I thought when I was watching the trailers it might be either some sort of underground slavery thing....it's not....or some sort of medical horror thing where white people are using black people to harvest their organs to the highest bidder....it's not that either.The solution to the mystery of the film is just nonsensical and makes the drama of the entire first part of the movie feel like a cruel joke on whoever bought a movie ticket.Don't waste your time on movie tickets, wait til it comes out on pay per view or comes out on DVD.And no spoilers"}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Being known for his half of the comedy duo Key and Pelle, writer, director, Jordan Peele seem to be doing something out of his element at first seeing that Get Out is a horror film, but this film has all his markings of his feelings on life that he has done many times over in his comedy.Chris is a black dude going out with a white woman, who takes him to see her family. He's worried about them flipping out when they find out he's black. He's got bigger things to worry about.It does have that feel of a Key and Peele sketch as Chris tries to be the only black man in an all white world. He hits it on the mark with the awkwardness of dealing with a society who has never interacted with a black person that did not work for them, and Chris' discomfort being the only black person in the house who is not serving the white folks. Then like all good Key and Peele sketches the movie ends on an extremely crazy scenario.Jordan Peele is a genius in the way he was able to create a film that was both a great horror film and funny as hell, but not because the horror was campy.You can relate to the social issues of race being handled in the film, and it's strange because most of it is not met to be funny at all, but it connects like Jordan is telling a joke.

Tonight, my review is on Get Out, a simplistically titled tale that is from the mind of Key & Peele's Jordan Peele! How well does a film directed/written by a comedian fare, as always, it's my job to share some thoughts, insights, and opinions on the latest film. So, stay in, grab a drink and read my thoughts on this \"epic\" film. LIKES: \u0095 Good Central Character \u0095 Comedic Relief \u0095 Well-Paced \u0095 Decent StorySummary: It's always good to have a character you can grip onto if you are going to watch them face the nightmares of this film. Chris is one of those protagonists that fulfills that role containing all the elements you want in a character: backstory, level headed decisions, not annoying, etc. Daniel Kaluuya is certainly one of the better horror genre actors, and portrays his role in a manner that doesn't want to make you roll your eyes, outside some emotional flatness the team made him portray. Yet the other actor to steal the show (not based on looks) was LilRel Howery as Rod the TSA. Rod's scenes are purely comedic, serving to relieve the tension the movie builds up and keeping it decently integrated into the story. These scenes, in addition to lightening the mood, keep the pace of the movie flowing to avoid that prolonged dragging feeling that many horror films seem to have. Such a pace kept the film interesting to me by keeping the suspense at a maximum. Perhaps the biggest strength to me, is that Get Out has a decent story laced with some originality. While not the scariest tale to hit the screen, this film has some hot topics built into the story (primarily racism and its wrongdoings) that go alongside the character building moments of the story. In addition, there is a nice twist to the tale, which may please many fans of this genre. DISLIKES \u0095 High Political Points \u0095 Unnecessary Scenes \u0095 Not scary \u0095 The ending being a little too easySummary: While Peele's writing is certainly impressive, tasteful, and clever at times, it also falls victim to being overly political for me at times. Get Out has many scenes were the extras throw the multiple judgmental stares, the rude, overstep their boundaries with too personal (and insulting) questions, or out of the way monologues about skin color that were more eye-rolling than necessary. It's not that I don't believe this issue exists, I just grow tired of directors deviating from the cleverness and pace of the story to make a point in these movies. Another unnecessary deviation was some of the comedic relief moments. Don't get me wrong, Rod's comedic relief was very welcome and had some of the best dialogue presentation of the film. However, there were moments where his scenes felt out of place, randomly thrown in there where they felt more like an SNL intermission than being pertinent to the story. Guess a comedian can't fully drop his roots. His comedic background may also be the reason this movie wasn't too scary either. Again, Peele has done the genre justice in terms of making a thriller with a decent plot that has some substance to it. But this movie failed to scare me at any point of the film, outside of maybe a few creepy stares from the brother or other staff. I think Peele tried to make it creepier from the realism aspect, but outside of that the jump scares were poor, the extras presentation was more annoying than scary, and the theme of the movie takes a different twist. Finally, when the movie reaches its exciting climax, Peele's writing definitely leaves you feeling fulfilled on many levels. However, much of that ending seems to be a little too conventional that takes away from what he built. Things happen in random succession and there are a few moments where logic (and realism) are dropped like so many hot potatoes it again becomes more humorous than fun. The Verdict:Despite my doubts, Get Out is a movie that stands out (in a good way) from many of the horror movies unleashed in the last few years. I always find value in a film has a good central character that has development and a well-paced, intriguing story to support it. In addition, while the comedy does have its out of place moments, the comedy is also a welcome diversion to make you laugh, fortunately in a manner that isn't overly stupid. However, if you are looking for a movie that will haunt your dreams and make you jump, this isn't the movie for you. Whether it is the lack of scare tactics or the overly political moments, Get Out's horror aspect is highly diluted in this film, feeling more like a mystery than anything else. Worth a trip to the theater? I'm on the fence about this one, but I have to say wait on this one until it hits home in a few months.

It does however pull punches in themes and topics that are definitely relevant to the current administration of the US and the people who voted for it. Yet, its more than that. The obvious, is that this film is about racism. The racism in this film is as obvious as a welcome and a smile in a West Texas town. That should give you an idea if you have been to west Texas.

Their daughter brings her black boyfriend to meet them for the weekend. It's a Brit who plays the boyfriend, Chris Washington, Daniel Kaluuya. You identify with him throughout.

It's just a broad and simple horror movie - seeing the poster for Gore Verbinski's A Cure for Wellness on the way out reminded me how much more complex and visually rich that is.

The reviews on this movie have been nothing but positive, and this one is no different!Although not having any \"big name stars\" on the casting sheet, those to me are usually the best horrors/thrillers. The ability to make someone pop on screen, and learn about that character just through dialogue is ornately done, and makes the conversation roll like R's off the tongue. The appliance of \"social flaws\", where its jokingly basically \"white people who say they aren't racist, but really are\" is indeed an underlying theme throughout the movie. Some comedic relief, and references get a giggle out of myself and the audience, but do not let the name \"Jordan Peele\" trick you into assuming this is purely Satire and comedy, when instead it is a borderline-flawless thriller/mystery.This movie's ability to allow us as the audience to fill in the missing holes, and \"piece together the puzzle\" is something I value GREATLY out of a thriller. Being my favorite genre, along with horrors, and having seen so many, it is hard to notch a solid result. With that being said, this movie hit every peg on my list, and impressed from start to finish.

But, watching this movie, it felt like he's been directing horror his whole life. To put it simply, the guy knocks it out of the park. It's an artfully crafted and remarkably accomplished debut. He exploits an atmosphere impregnated with tension and skillfully choreographs an escalation of unrelenting suspense and crowd-pleasing thrills. The camera-work was absolutely ingenious; there's a scene involving hypnosis, in particular that had my jaw hitting the floor. I loved how they visually achieved that heightened state of suggestibility on a visual level. GET OUT is as much satire as it is horror though. And its most impressive feat is how masterfully it blends the two together. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that so seamlessly shifts from sequences of jubilant laughter to instances of insidious horror in a matter of minutes. Writing satire is tough, writing good satire is even tougher, and writing good horror-satire is as rare of a commodity as you get in the film industry these days. To achieve this a film must have exquisite timing and near-prefect pacing, which is exactly what GET OUT has. The run-time is 103 minutes, yet it felt more like an hour. I guess I got so invested in this engaging story that I lost all sense of time, which is what you ultimately want in any movie, really. Daniel Kaluuya showcases his acting chops with an impressive range of emotions; it's not necessarily what he says but what he doesn't say that has the biggest impact. Other standouts include Allison Williams, Bradley Whitford, and Catherine Keener. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention comic Lil Rel Howery, who plays TSA agent Rod, aka the protagonist's best friend. He's definitely a scene-steal-er, breaking the film's uncanny tension with a number of gut-busting interludes.While GET OUT sets out to mainly entertain and shock, it's also accompanied with some poignant social commentary. It shines light on the aspect of ourselves that we'd rather not acknowledge. No matter how much we try to convince ourselves that we're above implicit stereotyping or forming preconceptions, we aren't. Peele uses this unavoidable, unflattering truth to draw out anxiety, and then he uses that anxiety as fuel for the film itself. GET OUT is one of the best movies to come out of 2017 thus far. I can't recommend it enough."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "I wish more horror films were as relevant and smart as Get Out. The movie feeds off a paranoia that the majority of the United States population doesn't experience on a regular basis. Fake smiles and awkward handling of racially charged conversations are masterfully put on display in the first half of the movie. The cracks in the white facade intensify at a steady pace. Uncomfortable questions or points start popping up in the viewer's mind. What is up with the eclectic decor (explicitly called out)? Why are all the black \"caretakers\" acting \"white\" on the property? Are we, as white people, really this ignorant? In short, you start to feel an entire system is out to get our protagonist. Admittedly, an early scene explicitly sets the stage up. Mainstream horror films play it safe with the usual jump scares and gory imagery. To be sure, Get Out sports a fair amount of both elements. At some point, all too shockingly familiar racism starts to out scare the traditional horror clich\u00e9s. Unfortunately, several dumb horror tropes also make an appearance. For example, you have that one horror scene where you have an odd figure chopping wood. The others tropes I could list involve spoilers. The acting is consistently top notch from all involved. I only have one minor quip with the casting choice of a peripheral character. The character certainly sticks out when you notice him and the inclusion is somewhat puzzling. Overall, the subject matter more than makes up for Get Out's very minor shortcomings. How often do movies aimed at a mainstream audience have the audacity to call out whites in America? The timing of the film's release is sadly impeccable. Racism is alive and well in our country. America \"smiled\" when she elected Trump as POTUS. I congratulate Jordan Peele for his impressive foray into directing. The film is dense and I certainly missed a few points on my first viewing."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "I was totally blown away by \"Get Out\". This is one of the best turns by an actor behind the camera I have ever seen (Jordan Peele). Probably the timely social commentary is going to loom heavily when discussing the film; however this shouldn't conceal the fact that this is a masterclass cinematic work that has been thought out to the very last detail; it knows what it wants to say and how to say it, balancing wildly contrasting tones and defeating potential clich\u00e9s with stylistic bravura. Of course everything stems from a rock solid script, where the plot points are cunningly engineered, and then fleshed out in a disciplined and take no prisoners kind of way. There is much to admire and enjoy here, including some surreal imagery that is as stunning as it is disturbing, always serving a purpose within the narrative; there are also brilliant soundtrack choices and you get subtle nods at the masters that came before (Kubrick and Wes Craven, specially). The plot involves one of those frequently visited \"fish out of the water\" type of settings where it's up to the director to make the most out of it. Which fortunately is the case here, since you get plenty of real character development and a tight, innuendo ridden dialogue that really gets under your skin. All this, together with the inspired camera work, contributes to the success of this tricky enterprise as a whole. Kudos to all the actors for going all the way with the provocative premise, considering that it could have totally backfired in less confident hands. Everything amounts to a deliciously wry slice of cinematic paranoia served with a side of cathartic humor that appropriately reflects the political times we are living in. And make no mistake, this is a true horror film that refuses to pull any punches; if you thought that Peele was just going for the laughs and the cheap scares you will get more than you bargained for. \"Get out\" will shock you silly and will make you think. Then you will want to watch it again and try to figure out how he pulled the trick."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "\"...I take devilish glee in making people uncomfortable\" - Jordan PeeleSir, you succeed. No room for sugar coating, as Jordan Peele did not do so in the slightest in 'Get Out'. This film may be one of my favorite films in the past decade and maybe ever. Again, one of my favorites, not all time favorite, calm down. This film was so brilliantly done from performance, to story, to the meaning behind it all, to the twists, just everything. I think what I truly loved about all of this is the originality behind it all. Jordan Peele wrote this and directed this. As it may have a few nods to past films (which, c'mon, what film does not take or at least nod to a past film?), it ultimately left me so satisfied to witness such a creative horror/thriller... Another thing this film did so brilliantly was keeping the audience curious until the very end. Although some things could be predicted, I personally still sat there thinking \"what in the f*$# is going on, what are these people doing?\". It is almost as if Jordan took his dark comedic skits from \"Key & Peele\" and eliminated the comedy and let the dark vibe of it run wild... Lastly, the performances. Applause all around to everyone involved. I hope to see some of these actors and actresses in more projects in the future. I received a very strong Robin Lord Taylor (Oswald Cobblepot/Penguin in 'Gotham') vibe out of Caleb Landry Jones and could foresee him taking on more villainous roles in the future. Betty Gabriel has been a favorite of mine with her involvement in \"The Purge\" films and seeing her involvement and performance in this film just reinforced that favoritism ten-fold. Daniel Kaluuya is a star-in-the-making, absolutely loved him in his main role. Last but not least, LilRel Howery stole the show. No matter how dark 'Get Out' got, LilRel's scenes are when the film takes a breath in the form of laugh-out-loud comedy.

In a very well-directed scene between Chris and Rose, we learn that Chris is reluctant to meet her parents - because as far as he knows, they are unaware of his skin color. When the couple arrive at the parent's house, Chris is greeted warmly - TOO warmly. It's even eerie. Over the course of his visit, Chris becomes increasingly uncomfortable in this place. I won't spoil anything, but this movie becomes more and more unsettling with each scene.Surprisingly, this movie functions as a comedic satire, a social drama, and a horror movie. Jordan Peele has found a way to send a message about modern racial prejudices, while incorporating hilarious comedic relief throughout. This movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's a good thing. However, it sure does scare. It scares you in a way that you weren't expecting. It toys with your emotions. You feel anxious for Chris' safety, you feel terrified of racism, and you feel amused with how over-the-top the entire movie is. \"Get Out\" takes plenty of risks.

It's certainly an unusual concept, and there aren't many movies out there like it.The set-up is that a young African-American man is going with his (white) girlfriend to visit her family. The acting in the film is strong, and the script is well-written and very clever. Through the dialogue, Peele manages to unpack the baggage surrounding the issue of racial tensions in the United States today. The film's tone is balanced nicely, with elements of horror, suspense, and comedy. Despite being marketed as a full-on horror film, and containing a couple brutal moments of violence, \"Get Out\" isn't that scary. However, the true intention of Peele is not to frighten in a superficial sense--it is to create a feeling of interwoven suspense within the story.\"Get Out\" isn't perfect, though. The film does drag in the middle to some degree, after starting off in an intriguing manner and finishing with a riveting climax and ending. Additionally, many of the characters (including some of the major ones) came off as very flat and under-developed.

Get Out may be the most impressive yet.I always talk about my disconnect with the horror genre and how I don't find much substance with 75% of the films. Get Out turns the genre on its head, doesn't rely on jump scares, is surrounded by tremendous performances, and has a socially relevant script. It is so rare for a film to have a socially relevant message without feeling too political or one sided. I can't tell you how many times I've appreciated what a film or a TV show is saying, but I get turned off by the way it's portrayed. Get Out manages to make an entertaining horror/thriller, while also commenting on unintentional and benevolent racism coming from a white family towards their daughter's new boyfriend, an African American.It's the racism most people don't normally think about.

Films like 12 Years of Slave and the recent documentary, 13th, are important. But it's films like Get Out that are more effective because they are giving the same message in a different way. Brilliantly written and structured, Peele gets the most out of his actors and times the laughs and scares in an effective manner. Please go out and support an original film like Get Out. You won't be disappointed.+Original+Laughs and scares+Really well acted+Pacing9.1/10"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "I'll start by saying that I really enjoyed this movie... and I mostly agree with (so far) the majority of reviewers positive comments about great casting, acting, writing and suspenseful story. I totally recommend seeing this movie... but you WILL be offended and probably not want to see this movie if:you are \"uncomfortable\" with interracial relationships- specifically between a Black man and White woman. This is actually sort of a theme in this movie, since many such relationships are depicted... including lots of smooching and a sex scene.you can't handle nearly every White character being vilified as \"evil\" (or racist) toward Black people. This is the director/writer's (Jordan Peele) type of humor, so if you can't handle Whites being \"made fun of\" or stereotyped, then steer clear of this one.Although there were a few previews for movies that are likely targeted more toward Black audiences (humor and culture-wise), this movie has a broader appeal just as long as the viewer doesn't have a big chip on their shoulder, and \"gets\" Jordan Peele's type of humor."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "I don't know what to say about this film beyond \"it is perfect.\" I can find literally nothing to complain about. The script is brilliant, the acting is great, Peele is a confident and talented director, the score is amazing, the comic relief is laugh out loud funny, and not just perfunctory \"sigh, comedy time\" funny, and the tone and mood are brilliantly handled.10 out of 10. If the Oscars weren't rigged, this would be a serious contender."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "I have seen bad comments on the trailer of this movie on some social media websites. Some people think this movie promotes division between races, we should be united, blah blah blah. This is just a movie! Just because this is about a racist white family does not mean it applies to you, or to all white people. This might sound obvious but you know that there's always dumb people who will take it personally. My advice: ignore bad reviews based on \"racism\"; it is an unfounded reason not to watch this movie.Now, the movie was good. Daniel Kaluuya is a great actor! This is not precisely a horror movie. The trailer makes it seem scarier, when it actually is just suspenseful and creepy. There were some laugh-out-loud moments of comic relief. Even though the movie is 103 minutes, it feels shorter. The ending was a bit underwhelming but left me content. Go see this movie. And if you think it's too scary go see it anyway. I asure you it's not. It was great fun for me and my family.7/10 for me."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Jordan Peele, one half of the comedy sketch series \"Key And Peele\" turns out to be a maestro horror movie director. Who knew?The film is not without it's laughs. They're all the bigger for their pitch perfect timing amidst the equally strong sense of unease and dread. The combination proves to be really potent, and the film blends it's humor, jump scares, atmosphere, and social satire seamlessly.The cast is essentially perfect. The film is relatively small in scope. It lurches maybe a little too hard into genre thrills in the third act, and I suppose I think the final reveal could've been eased into a little more gracefully.But on the whole, this is a very tense, funny movie with terrific performances and interesting ideas about the ubiquity of racism in society. Well worth checking out."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "This movie is appropriately in a genre Mr. Jordan Peele has christened, \"Social Thriller\". The movie creates a very unsettling feeling from the beginning that slowly builds to a crescendo, that forces the viewer to see prejudices head on. When all is said and done, you now have kind of a bird's eye view of what is wrong with society. But besides that, it hints a Hitchcock-type of thrill that is sure to deliver Goosebumps. A HUGE congratulations to Jordan Peele for hitting a HOME RUN, his first time up to bat. Looking forward to future projects from him. GO SEE, GET OUT. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00"}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "Get out was a movie that never hit the mark the trailers portrayed. The movie had some Ill-placed humor throughout. This humor not only pulled the viewer out of the story, but also felt forced and did not add to the plot. The movie was not over-the-top scary, but did had its share of suspense. I think the majority of the acting was superb and the cinematography and accompanying scores really set the stage for what could have been a great movie.The movies weakness lies in its storyline. The movie propagated the agenda for racial discourse by portraying white on black crime. This weak plot never allowed the viewer to become fully engaged. This shallow storyline at no point left the viewer feeling satisfied.I think this movie missed its mark entirely. It could have been a big hit if the story was more fleshed out with a different focal point. I enjoyed parts of it, but would not recommend it or see it again. I think A Cure for Wellness, which was released a week before, did a much better job of engaging the viewer."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Look, this is my first time leaving kinda like feedback for a movie in my entire life. I'm telling you all, go watch this movie, it's one of the best <3 . This movie will find its way to Oscar just wait and you will see what I'm talking about. Once again I encourage you people to go watch this movie, it will blow your mind."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Jordan Peele, the comedian that brought you Key & Peele, is at the helm of this low budget psychological horror flick and his first feature film director role. I am a very picky person when it comes to horror movies due to it being my favorite genre. With that being said, this movie is fantastic. One of the best horror films I have seen in a long time. The plot is unique to a genre that is plagued with clich\u00e9 and over the top violence. The movie follows Chris and Rose, Chris being black and Rose being white, as they take a trip to meet Rose's parents. Chris notices from the moment he meets her parents that something is off and he believes it to be due to his skin color. The racial aspect to the story is almost never explored in movies of this genre and it is a breath of fresh air. Get Out had me on the edge of my seat for the majority of the movie. The acting is well done and had me all over the emotional spectrum. I would Highly recommend this to everyone that is a horror movie fan. The horror genre has a new gem in the movie Get Out."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "Movie critiques have lost it giving this movie a 100% combined review score. Look, this is a solid little thriller, like the Gift meets Stepford Wives. This is almost a NO star cast. This is a low budget movie. It comes at a time when racial tensions need help and healing and not division and celebrating black vs white. Our country needs to get back on track FAST. Movie tickets are 10.00 each now. Wait for red box."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "I was intrigued by the fact that Jordan Peele (1/2 of the comedy duo Key\u00a0and Peele) was writing and directing a \"horror\" film that I decided to check it out. \u00a0Interestingly enough, I soon discovered that GET OUT, is NOT a horror film. \u00a0It is a suspense/action flick with horror and comedic elements.And it works, quite well.Following in the footsteps of suspense/horror/comedy films like the Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg SHAWN OF THE DEAD, GET OUT tells the story of Chris, a young African-American lad (Daniel Kaluuya) who is dating Rose, a caucasian (Allison Wiliams). \u00a0Rose invites Chris to meet his parents at her family estate. \u00a0Once there, Chris realizes that something is terribly wrong...Written and Directed by Peele, GET OUT zips along breezily for the most part, stopping for a moment for a piece of comedy or suspense. \u00a0The \"estate\" is very, very much WASPy\u00a0and white bread and all the victims are African-Americans, so there is a very real racial element to the story, but Peele does a good job of showing - and not telling - the inherent racism simmering just underneath the facade of those around him.And these facades are very good - as Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener play Rose's parents and they bring much more to the table than a typical film of this type might otherwise have. \u00a0Both are congenial, threatening, friendly and covert, showing us layers hidden under layers. \u00a0Stephen Root shows up as one of their white bread friends, who might be sympathetic to Chris. \u00a0Williams does a nice job as Rose adding to the tension. \u00a0Only Caleb Landry Jones as Rose's brother is too over-the-top. \u00a0The rest of the family are nuanced - he is not.But the star of this film is Kaluuya as Chris. \u00a0He is the audience surrogate in this film and brings us along in a winning fashion, trying very hard not to believe what he is seeing, but also slowly and shockingly coming to the realization that something is horribly wrong.Adding to the fun of this film is the breakout performance of LilRel Howery as Chris' friend back home. \u00a0His Rod Williams is saying out loud what most in the audience are thinking and he is quite hilarious. \u00a0I can't help but think that Peele had this film in his head for quite some time with his partner, Keegan-Michael Key playing Chris and Peele portraying Rod, for Rod has the funniest lines in and is the most winning character.If you are looking for a horror film, go see something else. \u00a0If \u00a0you are looking for an entertaining enough Suspense/Comedy/Horror film, than GET OUT fits the bill quite well.Letter Grade: \u00a0A solid \"B\"7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"}]
