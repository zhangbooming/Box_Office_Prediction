[{"score": "8/10", "review": "Lady Bird was very well-received at its local premiere at the Paramount Theater for the Austin Film Festival. I found it to be a sweet, charming coming-of-age film. It is a serious film, but with flashes of humor. Greta Gerwing wrote and directed the film which seemed to be partly autobiographical in that she grew up in Sacramento, CA at about the same time as her character. The film is a meditation on what it means to be from some place and what that idea of home means in shaping who you become. She has a love-hate relationship with her city, her family and her place in both. It is also very much a story of young girl struggling with her own and her mother's expectations for herself. The script is really charming with the best scenes being those of Lady Bird and her mother. Lady Bird is struggling with sexuality, family, friendship, religion and even her own name all at the same time. Like all of us, she is trying to find her place in the world. Saoirse Ronan is excellent as Lady Bird as is Laurie Metcalf in the role of her haggard struggling mother trying to hold her family together through difficult times. Recommended to those who like drama, particularly coming-of-age films."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Lady bird is a movie about a young woman and her struggling mother.

One of the cinematic delights of the year."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "This film received very high praise from early screenings and it wasn't hard to see why. Saoirse Ronan is a star, absolutely blowing everyone away in Brooklyn. Then you have Greta Gerwig, a force in a few Noah Baumbach films, with a highly anticipated directional debut. Was incredibly hyped for this one all the way through. It feels short because the film just flies by but its rather excellent. Very satisfied with the turnout for this one.The film is about Christine McPherson (Ronan) who has given herself the name \"Lady Bird\". She is a high school senior in a Catholic school who struggles through what a typical girl of that age goes through. She faces the trials and tribulations of dating boys, losing her virginity, trying to be popular, feuding with her best friend and mother, and ultimately trying to figure out what to do with her life. Things are tough for her and she examines her relationships with friends and family to ultimately come to the best decision for herself.The film sounds like a typical film plot. In many ways it is. Yet everything about the film is done so well in the expert hands of novice filmmaker Greta Gerwig. The dialogue is sharp, hilarious, and witty. The character development, interaction, and acting are all strong. Saoirse Ronan is at the very least sealing an Oscar nomination for best actress and might even go on to win it. It seemed like such an effortless performance for a girl who completely disappears into the character idiosyncrasies of Lady Bird. Its a wonderful coming of age film that hits all the check marks and does so very effectively.I can't think of any complaints. The film feels so real and identifiable. Its exactly what you want and is a very impressive debut from Gerwig. The film has a nice touch at the end and does what it needs to do to remain funny and touching. I don't mind a good coming of age comedy every year (Edge of Seventeen taking the cake last year). I expect this to be an award contender for at the very least Ronan's performance and Gerwigs writing and directing.8/10"}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Greta Gerwig's directorial debut is a very funny and entertaining film about a rebellious young woman who is a senior at a Catholic high school in Sacramento. She wants to attend college on the East Coast, preferably in New York City. I have always been a fan of Gerwig and her work, and I can say that her filmmaking skills are incredibly strong here as far as directorial debuts go. The screenplay is full of wit and emotion. While the film is very light in tone, the characterizations present through the narrative as well as the film's juxtaposition of its main events pertaining to Lady Bird's (the nickname of the protagonist) final year in high school give the script considerable weight and power.Saorise Ronan gives a hearty and very authentic performance in the lead role, and the supporting cast is generally very strong. The film's tone feels playful but also enjoyably sassy and thoughtful. As a result, the film feels far more potent than just about anything in the teenage/coming-of-age genre. While the film's pacing in its final scene feels slightly awkward given its contrast of pace with the rest of the narrative, the film feels fully satisfying in its entirety despite running a lean 93 minutes. Additionally, some of the plot devices that help form the narrative and plot line of the film feel rather predictable. However, that ends up being only a minor complaint because the humor, heart and bite of the writing helps drown out any sense of clich\u00e9s that a viewer might feel. Overall, I thought this was a great and very funny coming-of-age comedy that I had a lot of fun watching. I look forward to seeing what Greta Gerwig does next with her undeniable talent. Definitely recommended. 8.5/10"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "\"Lady Bird\". No, this film is not about Lady Bird Johnson! However, if you're a fan of films like \"The Big Stick,\" \"Juno,\" \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" and \"The Way Way Back,\" then writer/actor/producer Great Gerwig's solo run at directing/writing is going to be right up your alley. Saoirse Rona (\"Brooklyn\") stars as the reluctant yet blooming teenage who's at ends with her overly critical mom (the always amazing Laurie Metcalf - HBO's \"Getting On\"), while he dad (equally reliable Tracey Letts \"August - Osage County\" writer) sits quietly by. Since the story is a coming-of-age event, the excellent Lucas Hedges' (\"Manchester by the Sea\") and Timothy Chalamet (\"Interstellar\") each have a lesson to teach \"Lady Bird\". And, since every young female needs a BFF, Beanie Feldstein (\"Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising\") fits the bill just perfectly. Gerwig presents a believable, honest, enjoyable and at times heartbreaking story that will surly touch viewers. There are no gun battles, CGI effects, loud explosions, superheroes or animated cartoon figures here to dazzle. Instead, for a pleasant 1 1/2 hours, the audience is given an opportunity to step into the McPherson family life, and the life of fellow Sacramento California youth, to experience all the various trials and tribulations youth and families must endure during this thing call life. With an indie feel, \"Lady Bird\" could both join the ranks of the film mentioned above and lead the category into Awards Season."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Portraying a likable rebel is a hard thing to do on screen. You would have to set up why they are the way they are, and still be able to give them fleeting moments of empathy or just go all the way with no regrets. Lady Bird takes a stab at finding the balance from first time director Greta Gerwig in a relatively conservative scenery but does a lot to make her stand out in this hilarious coming of age story.Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan) is Catherine McPherson's given alias when she becomes bored living her familiar life while in a Catholic High School in Sacramento. Her new persona makes her become more wandering and naturally gravitating to many different things around her like boys, new female friends and the dream of finding more like herself in a east coast college away from home.Saoirse Ronan does a great job as a rebellious yet empathetic teenager as her angst does feel like it comes from a genuine place. What I've always had issues in the past from coming of age films is they make the teenagers problems feel self inflicted, but instead her character is coming more from a place of needing to explore more in life. The director also gives a lot of great snappy dialogue with all the characters and having some truly hilarious moments (there's a scene where the kids are slow dancing to Bone Thugs n Harmony's The Crossroads that has me screaming).As for faults, there aren't too many, but are more so nitpicks within this films wings. While the film has a great first and third act, the second act has a couple of dragging moments. It's not often or super noticeable, but some of the films strongest points are around the outer shell.Lady Bird doesn't reinvent the wheel of coming of age stories, however it does move with a lot of charm. Saoirse is great in he lead role, a really strong script and has you on a ride with a character learning from their mistakes and understanding how their actions affect others. Rating: 9.3 / 10"}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Lady Bird is the semi-biographical directing debut of noted indie actress Greta Gerwig. The film stars Saoirse Ronan as Christine 'Lady Bird' McPherson, a Sacramento teen whose uneasy shift into adulthood bears unpredictable and transformative results for her, her friends and her family. She dreams of moving as far away as possible for college, in part to avoid her contentious relationship with her mother (Metcalf). The prospect seems unlikely however given her father's recent unemployment. Thus while she waits, Lady Bird soaks in and learns from her encounters with her boyfriends, her run-ins with the well-meaning nuns at her out-of-touch Catholic School and the quirks of her dozy hometown.Much like Gerwig's breakthrough success Frances Ha (2012) (a film she also co-wrote), Lady Bird has a very frank, very refreshing honesty to it. The characters, both major and minor are flawed and sympathetic, the story and the city in which it takes place feels fleshed out; drawn with an appreciation and love that appeals to a certain sense of remembrance. It's not nostalgic \u2013 who truly can be nostalgic for 2002, a year Lady Bird notes for being a palindrome and little else. It's more like an honest examination of that awkward period in life after high school, before college where boredom, jadedness and sexual frustration can unknowingly turn you into the adult you will become.The honesty goes a long way in overcoming the usual teen dramedy clich\u00e9s. While the film stops just short of surprising audiences with the wholly unexpected, Lady Bird nevertheless spins its web of story lines in a unique configuration. The expected mother-daughter friction, the Catholic School repression and the pompous proto-douche boyfriend subplots are all here and accounted for but they're painted in with such care and loving detail. Like a Faberge egg this film is cognizant of tradition but encrusted with unique filigree all its own.Supporting cast members Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts are truly spectacular as Lady Bird's hardened but still loving parents. They both dominate different extremes of the parental spectrum (one overbearing, the other a little too free-wielding), yet both only want what's best for their children even if it costs them their pride, their finances and in one subplot their dignity. Beanie Feldstein and Lucas Hedges likewise make pretty good hay out their roles as Lady Bird's long suffering best friend and first boyfriend respectively. While it would have been nice to see more of Hedges exploring the deeper complexities of his character, what ends up on screen, works in serving the overall narrative.Saoirse Ronan is\u0085an interesting choice as an avatar for Gerwig's personal tale of adolescence and turmoil. The film requires her to be funny, charming, excitable, aggressive, and a bit of a brat depending on the circumstances. And while the young actress hits all those notes, she does so with an uncomfortable passivity that often risks making the movie about her environment as opposed to about her. One can't help but compare Ronan to the fearless Hailee Steinfeld of last year's Edge of Seventeen (2016) and wonder if by this time next year, we'll still be talking about the self-absorbed but not too self-absorbed Lady Bird? That along with the strong inference that Lady Bird is a lesser, spiritual prequel to Frances Ha means the film, for all its positives doesn't go all-the-way sort of speak. It's an honest movie and a lovely movie but not as truly transformative or life-changing as could have or should have been. The bad news is that means The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) will stay in the popular consciousness for only that much longer. The good news is hopefully that means Greta Gerwig is just getting warmed up. With a movie that ultimately feels as custom made as this one, I'm very, very excited to see what she comes up with next."}, {"score": "2/10", "review": "A trite, masturbatory piece tailored towards middle aged cat ladies and those on the path to becoming one. The drama, despite being filled with talent, lacked any semblance of depth, and could easily be likened to a comedy when you begin to view it in its proper context. It is essentially an incredibly mediocre male coming-of-age tale, but with the genders reversed. \"Lady Bird\" is the projection of what third wave feminists (for some reason) wish women were. She is the emotional pillar for those around her; she is stoic, bold, confrontational, daring, and always the first one to initiate romantic advancements. In other words, she is a caricature of masculine virtues and behavior, but as a *17 year old girl*. In the few places where she is found to be emotionally lacking, her parental counterpart (whose character is infinitely more believable by virtue of her background and hormonal makeup) steps in to fill the shoes (and/or pants). In accordance with this narrative, the men in lead roles have seemingly been injected with soy from birth. Soft-featured incompetent doughboys who lack the agency to engage life, functioning instead as submissive basket-cases, vectors through which Lady Bird asserts her outright dominance and emotional stoicism. That's the catch. That's the novelty driving this movies popularity (besides decent acting), a young girl who acts like a man. How risqu\u00e9, how compelling. The screenwriters and director should really give themselves a pat on the back for this one. Anyway, there's certainly more to be said of the social agenda etched into every corner of this films script, but I've not the time nor the patience to spend another minute of my life on this trash. It is completely incongruent with reality, and therefore unrelatable to anyone who isn't living vicariously through the protagonist.The only redeeming factor of the film was the degree to which this absurd gender reversal dynamic managed to add a veneer of comedy to virtually everything that took place (especially the \"serious\" scenes)."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "One of the best coming-of-age, mother-daughter films since JUNO and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT.

The main protagonist, Christine aka ''LADY BIRD'', she's not perfect! She has acne, she makes mistakes, etc, and played so wonderfully by Saoirse Ronan. Gerwig has really established herself as a strong director and screenwriter. Her screenplay is probably one of the strongest original screenplays. I look forward to watching again. Hopefully it will be a strong awards contender!"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Greetings again from the darkness. Joining the likes of Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Ben Affleck, Greta Gerwig proves her significance and brilliance is most apparent behind the camera, rather than in front. Her first feature film flying solo as writer and director is without a doubt, one of the year's best. Surely she has benefited from having a very talented live-in muse and mentor and partner in Noah Baumbach, but this extraordinary film is clearly Ms. Gerwig's passion project \u0085 and it's a thing of beauty (character warts and all).Ultra talented Saoirse Ronan plays Christine, aka \"Lady Bird\". She claims it's her given name \u2013 a name she gave herself. Entering her senior year of Catholic High School in Sacramento, she's the typical blend of teenage insecurity, bravado and restlessness. Her never quite satisfied mom is played by Laurie Metcalf, in what is probably her career best performance, and definitely worthy of Supporting Oscar consideration. A brilliant opening scene finds mother and daughter sharing a cry, which quickly devolves into one of the endless stream of arguments that make up half of their relationship. Their scenes together are sometimes caustic, always realistic, and likely to hit home to many mothers and daughters watching.Lady Bird is convinced she must escape 2002 Sacramento and live on the east coast, where she assumes culture thrives. This is the age where every teenager is convinced an amazing destiny awaits them \u0085 not stopping to contemplate what talent they possess that might actually contribute to society. Lady Bird is an average student who seems to dream not of greatness, but rather of some vision of life where she will be appreciated for simply being herself. So much of what happens is grounded in the reality of high school life, friendships, and family. She jumps at the chance to be friends with the \"it girl\" who controls the \"in crowd\". Leaving her lifelong best friend Julie (Beanie Feldstein, Jonah Hill's real life sister) in the dust, Lady Bird finagles her way into Jenna's (Odeya Rush) inner circle of rich kids, including the cooler-than-cool Kyle (Timothee Chalamet, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME). He's the bohemian-wannabe type we've all come across. Her attraction to Kyle results in confusion over her relationship with nice guy Danny (Lucas Hedges, MANCHESTER BY THE SEA). The film touches on many familiar topics, and the script elegantly handles each piece of the puzzle and gives each character their due. Lady Bird's middle class family is going through some financial difficulties after her dad is laid off. Tracy Letts is superb as the dad who is beaten down by a life that's nearly passed him by, but he staves off his own depression just enough to provide the basic strength needed by his wife and spirited teenage daughter. Mr. Letts and Ms. Metcalf aren't TV sitcom parents carefully positioned as punchlines for clever kids, like what we typically see. The emotional bond between parents and offspring is perfectly awkward and deep. Mother and daughter have their shared escapes, while father and daughter share some secrets. There is also a complex sister-brother dynamic, as well as the common issues of school days \u2013 teenage girl self-respect, class warfare, teacher crushes, and the pressures of extracurricular activities. Lois Smith has a couple of outstanding scenes as a wise and observant nun who sees Lady Bird for who she is, and provides the necessary guidance. Welcome comedy relief is combined with an editorial statement on the ongoing reductions in funding for the arts, as the football coach (Bob Stephenson) is put in charge of the drama department.Ms. Gerwig's excellent (quasi-autobiographical) film defies traditional categorization. It's part teenage comedy, coming of age, family drama, and character study \u2013 yet it's also so much more. Have you seen much of this before? Absolutely, and it's likely at least some of this has occurred in your own life, though you may not always enjoy being reminded. What is enjoyable is watching the work of a skilled filmmaker and exciting new cinematic story teller."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Ladybird is a movie directed by Greta Gerwig. It is a comedy about a young girl played Saoirse Ronan who moved to Sacramento with her family to live a new life. However she is struggling to adapt to strict Catholic school she is in and her family's financial difficulties. She is trying to establish healthy relationship with people around her, especially her mother. This is the first film that I have seen in a long time, where I didn't see a single trailer or a poster other than knowing Saoirse Ronan is in the film and apparently the film was very good. That's why in the plot summary I didn't say much because to say anything more would be to describe every single little details happened in the film. I always loved Saoirse Ronan and I think she is a very talented young actress with great potential. She was in Hanna, one of the most underrated actions in the decade and I loved her performance in Brooklyn and Grand Budapest Hotel. After the failure of the Host, she went to back indie root and played in more arty film. This is a pleasantly surprising good movie. When the film starts, you have the impression that it is a coming of age story, which it is, but as the film went on it goes deeper and even darker. It dealt with subjects like anxiety, depression and even sexual identification. However doesn't play off in a serious tone, after all it is a comedy, it felt normal and lighthearted. And that is something missing in our mainstream movies. We don't see a lot of movies that felt like we are watching something as if it was unfold to us in real life. It is mostly thanks to the amazing acting the cast offers. I would say this is the best performance Saoirse Ronan has to offer. Also the mother played by Laurie Metcalf was very good and even though she constantly conflicting with her daughter, you understand why she is frustrated and you can tell that deep inside she loves her more than anything else. And that is the biggest strength of the film: because it felt so real and lighthearted, you felt every emotion the characters felt; joy, anger and pain. You understand how and why everyone do the things they do. I am surprised how dark some of the subject matters got, well at least for me personally. Last but not least, I have to mention the clever editing used in the film and its beautiful cinematography. I don't have too much complaint with the film, but there are a few nick picks. One of them was the pacing. The film is only 1 hr 33 mins long. There some scenes felt a bit rushed. I wish the film could slow down at times. The biggest flaw in the film I felt is with the ending. I won't spoil it but I felt it could be executed better and I thought it dragged a bit. What is more, some of the characters arcs are not resolved, but it doesn't bother me that much. Lady Bird is a very surprisingly good movie. I had a great time with it and made me feel hopeful. It is one of the best coming of age comedy I have seen. Even with its minor flaws I would highly recommend it to people. And if you are a teenage experiencing hardship, go watch it, it will make you feel better. 8.5/10"}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "We each have nicknames given to us by loved ones. My dad always called my sister \"boop\" (for reasons unknown), and he called me \"TFF\" for \"Trevor-fo-fevor;\" one friend of mine went by his middle name \"Xavier,\" and another calls his daughter \"goose.\" Nicknames always become so personal because they say practically everything about the bond between the name's owner and the name's caller.So what could be told about a girl who gave herself the nickname Lady Bird? One, she has high self-dependency. Two, she seeks image confidence. Three, she feels too distanced from mom and dad to accept their nicknames. Indeed, you learn even more about Lady Bird as her graduation impends- class of 2003.Lady Bird just wants to fly away from dull old Sacramento for college on the East Coast; her disrespect upon the confused adults seems understandable enough, since 9/11 still dawdles fresh in the nation's memory. However, Lady Bird only knows Sacramento's restrictive side. Director/writer Greta Gerwig, along with the small production crew, pays off their united vision in a humble, down to earth fashion similar to an early 2000's comedy. Gerwig's often slow/often fast approach documents Lady Bird's problems under the awkward pressure of growing up into the unknown: awareness about weight gain, knowing who her real friends are, uncertainty about sexuality, plus more you survived in your youth.Lady Bird's oppressive school adds but an extra layer of confusion. The familiar details of a religious institution restrict every teen's need for self-discovery: dancers keep ten inches apart for the Holy Spirit, skirts below knee level, etc. Lady Bird expresses her attitude about the rules by the way she casually eats the communion wafers as if they were goldfish crackers.Yet the girl's shaky maternal bond most allows the coming of age story's real heart to bloom. Right away the two argue in the car about college, a disagreement she ends by opening the door to the pavement. Now a pink cast on her forearm, a profanity written on toward the one she accuses as responsible, explains their whole relationship. Contrary to Lady Bird's assumptions, mother truly loves her, as expressed through a clear balance between disciplined silence and a compassionate ear to keep Lady Bird's head on straight. You may even notice a subtle role reversal, proving Lady Bird's invisible likenesses to her family. So I wholeheartedly recommend Lady Bird for any mother-daughter night out.While the script's more personal than usual, it still comes off one- sided, mainly against Lady Bird's overly oppressive Catholic school experience. Both inside and outside the school, Lady Bird's rebellious actions, such as shoplifting, play either for cheap laughs or to cast a stark shadow over religion. Her two older adoptive siblings also contribute little plot importance besides forgettable reactions about her attitude. These two piercing studded emos of ethnic color should have been more down-to-earth voices of reason, ones different from the parents or teachers, but this opportunity is missed.Gerwig's approach predominantly passed the opportunity of true love for Sacramento as a location. Remember that song about West Virginia? A love letter about the state's old life: older than the trees and younger than the mountains? No comparable love for the city of Sacramento resolves Lady Bird's matters in a satisfying fashion by the end.An added complaint goes to the crew's decision to cast 23-year-old Saoirse Ronan to play a teenager, even though she looks too old to play someone underaged. A couple of the other actors halt the enjoyment, particularly Lucas Hedges' (Manchester by the Sea), clumsy performance as Lady Bird's little turtle-dove.Although many other strong performances keep the production's awards thirst hydrated, especially Oscar-bound Laurie Metcalf, who vigorously plays Mrs. Lady Bird. Stephen Henderson, the underrated thespian from Fences, satisfies as well as the school's cheerful old drama coach.So, if I had a nickname for Lady Bird, it would still embrace the initials LB, for \"Loving Believability,\" as you believe the low points and love the high points.

We all knew a Lady Bird. In high school, in college, at work. Male or female. The misfit toy, the square peg, the rebel without a cause.

Extraordinary by just being who they are and unafraid of what others will think of them in doing so.Lady Bird is a triumphant film of 2017. Only one emotion swept through me as I sat and watched. Pure joy. Lady Bird is an entirely memorable character. In some ways, a feminist answer to Max Fischer from Rushmore. The way she navigates through her humble catholic school upbringing is hilarious. She uniquely adapts to the pitfalls of the coming-of-age. The discovery of love, sex, popularity, rejection and the anticipation of college. At the same time, Lady Bird wishes she was something more and much to the chagrin of her own mother, who wishes she could just be normal. Laurie Metcalf's performance as Mrs. McPherson is heartbreaking and real. A mother in the cross- hairs of unconditional love and utter disappointment in her daughter. Lady Bird's dynamic with her mother thought the film is chilly and dismissive, but deep inside, she fully appreciates all that she has given to her, and vice-versa.As a former socially anxious, awkward teenager, I can certainly relate to wishing I were somewhere else, wishing I was someone I wasn't and perhaps unappreciative of what I already had. Lady Bird doesn't just simply rehash the coming-of-age story for us all to harken back to way back when, but to reflect in an adult manner, what it means to have a family that cares about you through it all.

Saoirse Ronan plays Christine \"Lady Bird\" McPherson, who is a rebellious and eccentric young woman who wants anything but staying home in Sacramento for life beyond high school.The film moves at a rapid pace and for a good chunk of the film you don't really know the direction the film is taking. \"So what is really the point?\" is the question I continued to ask myself. But in reality, the answer was right in front of me. This film is about a mother and a daughter, the trials and tribulations they go through, but how they ultimately realize the love they have for each other is mutual though constantly tested. And even though this film is certainly a comic of age story, it by no means is your typical romantic coming of age where boy meets girl or vice versa.This film is a coming of age story of a mother and daughter. Both tremendously played by Laurie Metcalf and Saoirse Ronan respectively. What I found so compelling is that as weird as Lady Bird can be in her approach to life, it's still written in a way that is relatable to the average person. In fact, I can't say that I know first hand what that relationship is like, being a guy, but there's something so special about the way these two people rip each other apart but are aware of the meaning of each other's presence in their lives. Writer-director Greta Gerwig does such a beautiful job of presenting this scenario in several scenes throughout the film. And really, I shouldn't expect anything less from her with the particular choices she has made with acting in the last decade or so.From Gerwig's fast moving script, to the bold choices made by Metcalf and Ronan, to the strangeness of Lady Bird's character, all the way to the heart breaking moments towards the end, Lady Bird is easily one of my favorite films of the year.

Social distinctions figure prominently in Gerwig's cinematic world of \"ironic class strivers.\" I keep wondering why I am left cold by her words and her characters and eventually understood that LADY BIRD is too self-consciously trying to be inclusive - inclusive of every contemporary issue - touching upon a diversity of characters and situations with momentary episodic flashes.The touch is light, illustrating concerns rather than delving into them, giving us tokenism - glossing over deep pain and longing with a CliffsNotes diminution.Saoirse Ronan is excellent as Christine \"Lady Bird\" McPherson - a nickname she gives herself to appear distinctive. I am sympathetic to the aspirations of a young, self- involved teenager searching for a path to glamour and excitement. Youth is an innocent time - one open to endless fantasies - reality has not yet penetrated the hermetic world of dreams. The \"firsts\" of the teen years - first kiss, first sexual experience leading to the loss of virginity, first self-awareness of one's own ethical and moral values, and the critical realization that the world is not always spinning for you alone - solely for your personal gratification.The film opens with Lady Bird and her mother - a wonderful performance by Laurie Metcalf - who is driving and listening to Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath on audio tape - both simultaneously weeping, moved by the beauty of the spoken words; their mirrored responses reflect their enduring affection. And suddenly the mood is shattered and we see the other side of their relationship - a mother who works double shifts as a psychiatric nurse to supplement the family income so that her daughter can go to a private Catholic school; the burden of monetary expenses weighs heavily on her shoulders. The ever-present resentment that comes with sacrifice is often unleashed on her oblivious daughter in a torrent of sarcasm, humiliation, and disparagement.Greta Gerwig is at her best in the scenes between mother/father and daughter. A lovely tenderness exists which is often choked and stifled by the exigencies of financial straits.The underpinnings are there for a truly fine movie, but in the rush to cast a wide net, Gerwig compromises her subjects' humanity, placing a veil of bromides over what could have been profound interactions.

Saoirse Ronan plays self-named \"Lady Bird\" Christine, the Catholic Girl School senior doing her best to leave her hometown in Sacramento in 2002. Laurie Metcalf plays Marion \u2013 Christine's Mother, who is the workaholic nurse covering double shifts to make ends for her family. Her husband, Lady Bird's Dad Larry, played by understanding Tracy Letts, who suffers clinical depression is laid off from his job. Lady Bird has a \"step-brother\" Miguel, played by bright Jordan Rodrigues, the UC Berkeley graduate working at 7 Eleven. Lady Bird and her Mom have the biggest hearts, yet often not gracious for each other. Lady Bird's chaste boyfriend Danny, played by Lucas Hedges, confesses \"Your Mom is so hard on you\u0085\" Lady Bird defends, \"\u0085 She loves me.\" In the moving scene, Lady Bird and Mom shop for prom dresses. Lady Bird asks her Mom, \"Do you like me?\" Mom replies \"I want you to be the best version of yourself.\" Lady Bird says, \"What if this is the best version?\" Apparently, that isn't enough. They break your heart. Ronan and Metcalf have profound authentic screen partnership. Ronan is raw, hysterical, and compassionate. Metcalf is strength and tenderness in her quiet and measured words. \"Lady Bird\" is hilarious and touching in humanity. It celebrates being and loving the best version of yourself, acknowledging the unconditional love of those who see and listen you as greater. Director Gerwig's debut feature boldly looks at life touching all our hearts. In the opening car ride home after visiting State universities Lady Bird and Mom argue. Lady Bird wants to go to college back East. Her Mom reminds that they can't afford that, and besides she doesn't have the grades. Hysterically, Lady Bird opens the car door and leaps out the moving car. Later we see her back in Catholic School with pink cast on her broken arm. Gerwig brilliantly captures our attention. Lady Bird's best friend is Julie, played by kind hearted Beanie Feldstein, who is the sweet girl who suffers some over her appearance. Her divorced Mom has a live-in boyfriend. Math whiz Julie crushes on her teacher Mr. Bruno, played by Jake McDorman. Lady Bird would like to be on the Math Team, but she isn't good at math as Sister Sarah Joan, whimsically wise Lois Smith, points out. Instead the Sister convinces her to try acting in a play with another school. It's love at first sight for star Danny, gentle Hedges. Danny from the big Catholic family betrays Lady Bird in the surprise reveal. In her cultural exploration she jettisons BFF Julie for rich girl Jenna, haughty Odeya Rush, and pursues her romance with mysterious loner musician Kyle, charming Timothee Chalamet. Turns out mysterious is really the conspiracy theorist kid with the tragic family. Meanwhile, Lady Bird enrolls her Dad (Lett) to help her apply to East coast colleges unbeknownst to Mom. Lady Bird does her best to invent that best version of herself. Ronan makes us laugh and cry along the way. I laughed so hard while Lady Bird and Julie lie on the church floor eating communion wafers discussing the uses of \"shower heads\". When Ronan compassionately hugs Danny, who confesses his fear, I cried. When she holds Julie who doesn't have a prom date, who says \"Some of us aren't built for happy.\" I had the biggest smile. As exasperated Mom tells her daughter, \"It's never enough!\" that breaks Lady Bird's heart and ours.\"Lady Bird\" has the biggest heart of any movie I've seen. Ronan makes this so. Ronan and Metcalf reveal that unconditional love of Mother and Daughter in their fierce words and silence. They touch with their humanity. We are all the better for it. In the end saying, \"I love you\u0085\" is more than just thanks. That expresses the best version of ourselves. I think \"Lady Bird\" is the best movie of the year. At least it is my very favorite."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Saoirse Ronan stars as Christine \"Lady Bird\" McPherson, a teenager in Sacramento, California in Greta Gerwig's solo writing/directing debut. She is not a terribly good student, nor does her family have any money to speak of, but she is committed to attending university in NYC. The film follows her episodically through her last year of high school, showing her relations with friends, boys and her intensely critical mom (Laurie Metcalf). This is a low key, extremely engaging film that I thoroughly enjoyed, but didn't really blow me away as I was watching it. It snuck up on me though ... it has some really beautiful moments that surprise with how they deal with familiar material in novel ways. Playwright Tracy Letts (\"Bug\", \"Killer Joe\") is great in a low key role as her father."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Coming-of-age films from green, independent filmmakers have a tendency to hit their mark at a surprisingly higher rather than other stories, but something about Greta Gerwig's \"Lady Bird\" feels more like a bull's-eye. Her semi-autobiographical snapshot of a high school senior exploring her identity has an assured wit and a firm grasp on the emotional truth of that life stage.Even though she's playing someone close to her age, Saoirse Ronan continues to display a dazzling versatility as Lady Bird/Christine, a young woman at a Catholic private school who dreams of escaping her native Sacramento to attend a college or university on the East Coast. Consequently, she rejects the pragmatism of her middle-class, blue-collar parents (Tony winners Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts), namely her well-intentioned but admittedly cold mother. Determined not to let anyone put her in a box, Lady Bird subconsciously turns her senior year into an experiment in self-discovery, hoping to fashion an identity that suits her and the vision she has for her life.Gerwig's script is not guided by plot so much as story lines that emerge and drift away, some of which are fleeting and some of which run throughout the course of the film. In addition to college acceptance, there's her foray into drama club, a couple romantic interests and her ongoing challenges with her mother. The film comes together with brilliant editing, especially the moments of comedy. With the help of editor Nick Houy, Gerwig demonstrates uncanny comedic timing in the way she constructs scenes. \"Lady Bird\" earns and accumulates laughs early and effortlessly, and so much of the force behind the humor comes from quick, well-timed edits. Also, her cast is clearly having a blast making this movie and she makes sure the camera is there to capture the funniest, most authentic moments.The editing also plays into the dramatic elements as well. Gerwig has incredible belief in the viewer to connect the dots and intuit the emotional consequences of the bigger moments in the story. The film's first big moment of melodrama, in which Lady Bird makes a startling discovery in the bathroom, jumps immediately to some several minutes or hours later, when she and her best friend Julie (Beanie Feldstein) have an emotional moment to Dave Matthews Band's \"Crash Into Me.\" Most films would've resorted to melodrama and really stewed in these moments; Gerwig keeps her film moving.it's amazing what she fits into 94 minutes. The mileage she gets out of each scene and the moments she includes in this story is a lot of what sets \"Lady Bird\" apart. She's able to trim all the fat because the meat of the story is so substantial. Every interaction, every character brings something to the table and exhibits this universal truth that there's a side to everyone that isn't visible in how they appear and behave, a lesson Lady Bird badly needs to learn. The most tender and sensitive example is in the mother-daughter relationship that in many ways is the central dynamic of the film. Lady Bird and Marion represent the clash of idealism and pragmatism that are so often at the core of teen-parent discord and the scenes they have together perfectly encapsulate that tension, but also the love and bond. Metcalf's performance captures all the love and devotion and the stubbornness and frustration that makes her both the \"villain\" of the film and the one you sympathize with. Marion and Lady Bird are so authentically realized in the writing and in the performances that it's almost like being able to step back and objectively look at your own parent-child relationship.Although most audiences won't quite relate to the film's \"love letter to Sacramento\" aspects, dreaming beyond or feeling attached to where you grew up is still a universal sentiment, one that Gerwig handles with care because in so many ways that push-and-pull embodies a lot of the wrestling that \"Lady Bird\" does on the more micro level with its characters. So many films touch on this aspect of growing up, but \"Lady Bird\" makes and arrives at these critical points with the kind of authenticity and thoughtful, intentioned writing that the film feels as though it's a collection of someone's actual lived experiences and relationships. Gerwig's voice and Ronan's performance meld into one truthful story that hits all the funniest and most sincere notes without lapsing to clich\u00e9s and conventions, a truly special feat of filmmaking from a first-time director.~Steven CThanks for reading!

As the movie opens, Lady Bird and her mom are driving back to Sacramento as they are listening to an audio tape of Grapes of Wrath. Lady Bird laments \"I wish I could live through something\" and then lets herself fall out of the car, breaking her wrist along the way. Now in a cast, we get to know Lady Bird's daily life as she enters her senior year in high school at the all-girls Immaculate Heart of Maria. Lady Bird also has to deal with her overbearing mom. It all makes her want to go to college on the East Coast... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the directing debut of noted actress and writer Greta Gerwig (Frances Ha, Mistress American, Maggie's Plan, and most recently sensational in 20th Century Women). Here Gerwig writes about something very familiar to her, as she grew up in Sacramento (but she refuses to call the film auto-biographical): the struggles of a teenager on the cusp of the liberating (?) years of going to college and setting out a life's journey more within her control. Even though the movie is just an hour and a half, it is jam-packed with non-stop plot developments, but the over-arching theme is clear. While billed as a comedy-drama, the movie is more drama than comedy, indeed the movie is bitter-sweet, but in the end more sweet than bitter. Gerwig provides outstanding direction to her two lead performers, Irish actress Saoirse Ronan (as Lady Bird) and Lauren Metcalf (as her tough-love mother). I can't help but feel that the movie is also Gerwig's love letter to her home town of Sacramento (a place I've never visited myself), making it look very warm and inviting. Bottom line: \"Lady Bird\" is a wonderful 'little' movie, and in that sense the complete opposite (and perfect counter- programming) for yet the latest salvo of superhero action movies from DC Comics (\"Justice League\") and Marvel Comics (\"Thor Ragnarok\"). To each their own, but I'll take \"Lady Bird\" any day.\"Lady Bird\" received immediate critical acclaim upon its premiere at the Telluride Film Festival earlier this Fall, and surely will be receiving a number of Oscar nominations early next year. The movie went wide this past weekend. The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (exactly 4 people, including myself), but positive word of mouth will hopefully boost better attendance in the days and weeks to come. If you are in the mood for a character study that will feel very familiar to many of us, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. \"Lady Bird\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Lady Bird is a straightforward and affectively written coming-of-age story composed of identifiable characters and dilemmas regarding adolescence and family relationships with strong performances to back them up. It's marvelous how these art house films where you are essentially watching an everyday person's life go by can sneak in a subtle narrative and effortlessly absorb the audience. Lady Bird is filmmaking at its purest, another 2017 great."}, {"score": "3/10", "review": "Although this movie was only about an hour and a half it felt like over two hours. I kept looking at my watch to see when it would end. The acting was good, but the plot felt like the writer took everything that could affect a teenager and threw it into a movie. I generally like thought evoking movies, but this one was just not compelling. Of the three people I went with, only one would recommend it and then only to a limited viewing audience. A lot of people really liked this movie, at least in the reviews, but there no one in the audience was saying how much they loved the movie as they exited the theater."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "I really enjoyed LADY BIRD. One of the *best* films of the year! I totally related to the story especially the protagonist relationship with her mother and friends, and the dream of moving away to college! I watched LADY BIRD in a packed theatre with people of all ages which was fantastic to see because I've rarely seen a packed theatre for an 'independent' film! There were laughter and tears throughout. I think Gerwig has made a film for the ages. Her script is really strong and her direction too. The acting is remarkable especially Saoirse Ronan (never puts a foot wrong) and Laurie Metcalf who plays the mother so darn well! The supporting call are really great too-Beanie Feldstein, Tracy Letts, Lucas Hedges & Timothee Chalamet. This film *deserves* lots of awards love for sure! 10/10"}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "I went into Lady Bird fully expecting to dislike the character of Lady Bird. From the trailers, she seemed like a self centered ungrateful brat. To some extent that holds true, it takes the self- named \"Lady Bird\" a while to consider the needs or feelings of others, but she experiences tremendous development over the course of the film. She really is an ordinary teenager, a confused girl who is simultaneously self-obsessed and tremendously empathetic.Saoirse Ronan brings a ton to the role of Christine \"Lady Bird\" McPherson, a teenager trying to find her way in the world. She hates and loves her mother, brilliantly played by Laurie Metcalf, but she struggles to cope with those two conflicting feelings.Laurie Metcalf really elevates the role of Lady Bird's mother, she is perfectly described by one character as warm, but scary. She loves Lady Bird, but she doesn't really like her because she sees how much more she could be if she is able to get her head on straight. Metcalf should win an Oscar for this role as she is really what makes the whole thing work. The core of the entire film is the relationship between Lady Bird and her mother, and Ronan and Metcalf are perfect in how they play off each other here."}, {"score": "5/10", "review": "I hated it. It was like watching an episode of Blossom. The only good part of the movie was Lucas Hedges, and he's barely in it. I thought I was going to see a cool, funny indie movie after seeing the trailer. But it was just a poor teenage girl in catholic school movie. I'm not a poor teenage girl in catholic school, so I could not relate."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "So refreshing to go to the theater and watch an honest coming-of-age story about community, family & friendship for a change. Saoirse Ronan gives a fantastic performance playing Christine, the ''hard-done by'' teenager, and Laurie Metcalf as Marion, Christine's overbearing mother. The supporting cast all give incredible performances too. I would describe LADY BIRD as a *universal* story. Greta Gerwig has created a masterpiece considering this is her first *solo-directorial* debut and her writing is so spot-on too.

Beanie Feldstein stars as 'Lady Bird' best friend Julie, all of her scenes with 'Lady Bird' were good, their friendship goes through the motions, and it's pretty entertaining.The various boyfriends of 'Lady Bird' come in and out, but that's usually how it is in high school, friends come and go.Overall, I enjoyed the movie Lady Bird. The relationship between Lady Bird and her mother was all great, the comedic stuff with Lady Bird and her brother was funny, the friendships and boyfriends that came and went did hold my interest, and I had fun and enjoyed the journey of Lady Bird.For a more in-depth review, check out my video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLaxCE6Tr_8"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Much has been said about this movie being a story of a mother (played by Laurie Metcalf) and her daughter \"Lady Bird\" (played by Saoirse Ronan). It's true that their relationship is a central theme in this \"dramedy\" but it is also a story of a father and his daughter. Lady Bird's father (played by Tracy Letts) is loving, gentle, sympathetic and sensitive to the changes in Lady Birds life. Even though he is going through some very tough times himself (depression & unemployment), his support for his daughter never waivers and we see him providing the emotional stability that Lady Bird desperately needs during her curious, awkward and turbulent high school years. Just as it seems her life is seeing some sunshine, unexpected events knock her back down again. However, Lady Birds incredibly positive spirit picks her up and puts her right back in the game. She refuses to let embarrassment or hard times rob her of the best years of her life and I think the audience is right their on the sidelines cheering her on. Greta Gerwig's script is fresh and unpredictable and the acting is superb. Lady Birds story does not demand as much of Saoirse Ronan as her incredible role in Brooklyn (robbed of the many awards it truly deserved). But Saoirse nailed this role leaving no stone unturned with her great American accent, and wonderful sense of comedic timing."}]
