[{"score": "8/10", "review": "The new feature from the Safdie Brothers, Good Time, is utterly incontrovertible proof of Robert Pattinson's talent. A skilled young actor who broke out young, Pattinson, like his equally skilled former co-star Kristen Stewart, has been plagued by his \"Twilight\" image, and accordingly (and unjustly) derided because of his involvement. The truth is that both Pattinson and Stewart are audacious and feverishly talented young actors, and Good Time will convince all who see it that Robert Pattinson is a fearless and versatile actor. As an ashen-faced, stubble-laden, nervy-eyed criminal thrust into a constantly escalating trip into the recesses of city nightlife, where stakes are always high, Pattinson relishes in the opportunity to inhabit this character and fully realise all his traits. His pretty-boy-image disappears into an expertly assembled composite of agitated mannerisms and a thick Bronx-like brogue. The film excels in its visuals. The Safdies adore neon light, which leads to many memorable neon-drenched sequences, such as an extended sequence in a haunted-house theme park that reels in the tension. Much of the film takes place at night, allowing for some atmospheric, neo-noir vibes to come to the fore. What also must be credited is the unrelenting pace of the film, living up to its cheeky title through constantly escalating stakes, a thunderously exciting electronic score and a plot that keeps throwing delightfully absurd and insane twists to keep you constantly engaged. Good Time been likened a lot to Dog Day Afternoon, Sidney Lumet's taut and incredible bank-heist-gone-wrong film, and it's a comparison that is apt, if a bit flattering; the Safdies come close to matching that film's inspired lunacy and delirious tension, through a decidedly more modern aesthetic. The Safdies directorial style is unique, and I'll be honest it at times got on my nerves. I noticed early on that almost every shot is a close up, often hand-held, which can feel claustrophobic, but also just irritating. That being said, I grew used to the style, and eventually understood its purpose, in buttressing the manic instability of its protagonist, and his morally questionable odyssey. Even so, the style was not always seamless with the narrative. Make sure you don't sit too close to the screen when you watch this film. Good Time is an exciting, pulsating, modernised noir/New Hollywood thriller that deserves a lot of praise for its terrific suspense and Pattinson's bravura turn."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "#GoodTime is a fantastic insomniac crime comedy/thriller with the fully determined & daring #RobertPattinson. It's like if \"Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels\" met \"Trainspotting\" and had a Red Bull-fueled baby. It's entertaining through and through.Directed by Josh and Ben Safdie, Robert Pattinson plays Constantine Nikas who commits a botched bank robbery that lands his younger brother in prison. The rest of the film shows Nikas' dangerous attempt in a span of one crazy night just to get his brother out. Madness, mayhem and violence ensue as he also tries to evade the consequences of his actions.I haven't watched \"Heaven Knows What,\" but I am now definitely a big fan of the Safdie brothers after \"Good Time\" because their vision and craftsmanship are simply hypnotic. Not only do they play with neons and glows but also almost the entire time, the film is done with close-up shots which tightly frames the characters so much so that it intensifies the story's unpredictability.The characters in \"Good Time\" may not be quite as dumb as the characters in the Coen Brothers' crime comedies, but they're quite rudderless. Nikas knows that his main objective is his brother, but he doesn't have a clear plan. He's got bits and pieces of what can be considered close to a plan but for the most part, he just wings it, which makes this whole thing hilarious. It's as if the script intentionally throws a curve ball at him every other five minutes or so, you see him encounter unexpected blunders, mostly of his own doing as he's winging it from one cluster- mess after another. He's always on the go. And Robert Pattinson is marvelous, some say this is his breakout performance, I say it's the performance that no one else but him could play. Pattinson becomes this desperate loser, part of you empathizes with him but part of you wants to see him get what he deserves. \"Good Time\" is a helluva way to end this summer season at the movies.-- Rama's Screen --"}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Very ironic title as a good time was not had by Constantine \"Connie\" Nikas (Played by Robert Pattinson who I'm sure is having a good time over the praise he's getting from the film). His brother lands in jail after a bad bank heist and Connie is trying to raise the bail money to get him out, which turns out to be a serious night walking down the danger zone.Robert Pattinson does do an amazing job in this movie. I come from a stand point of a person who has never scene Twilight so I have little impression of who he was really as an actor prior, except to say he looks very different now and the difference is better. You can compare this performance in this to DiNiro's in Taxai Driver, it does stand up like that.I really liked what the Safdie brothers have done here. Ben (Who doubles as co-director and plays Connie's brother, Nick) and his brother, Josh have created a well told adventure here through the gritty part of The city, using that strange retro 80s style all the fresh young directors in their thirties seem to be doing. Good Time is raw and grounded yet slick and stylistic. Makes me want to see the rest of their filmography.It's oddly colorful and filled with characters. It does not seem like the type of movie people would get but it's relateable, thanks in large part to the focus on Mr. Twilight, cause it does pay to have a well known actor in your movie.Good watch!http://cinemagardens.com"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "When I had read about Good Time in the New Zealand International Film Festival catalogue I had thought it would be old wine in a new bottle but I anyway planned to watch it because I am a sucker for heist based thrillers. After watching the film yesterday I realized that this film is no old wine but a distinctly tasty elixir that I never knew existed. There is a hilarious twist in this film that acts like a virtual bridge between the initial events and the final events.The film is infused with moments of frustration, disruption and ambition and the director makes sure you easily slip into the muddled -up mind of the character played by Robert Pattinson who by the way has evolved in leaps and bounds as an actor over the last few years. Good Time is about not being at the right place at the right time. The Safdie brothers have done a brilliant job in telling a great heist story whose most prominent trait is the suppressed humour with which the film is laced."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "Good Time is a dark and gritty crime drama that is set to a driving techno beat and takes place on the streets of New York City. The movie begins with two brothers botching a bank robbery job where one brother Nick, played by co-director Benny Safdie, gets caught and sent to prison and the other brother, Robert Pattinson (from the Twilight movies) ends up on the run, pursued by the authorities and trying to find a way to get his brother out of jail.Both actors give stellar performances. Nick (Benny Safdie) as the mentally challenged brother and Robert Pattenson gives such a hard core performance as brother Connie you'll easily forget he was a teen heart throb vampire in the Twilight movies. The movie starts off with a bang (literally) with plenty of action and a musical soundtrack that keeps you enthralled. (The soundtrack is probably one of the 5 best of the year.) The problem for me was at some point the movie turns into \"Groundhog Day\" with the same situations happening over and over again. It's a movie that ends with a whimper. I give the movie high marks for its direction by the brothers team of Benny and Josh Safdie and the visuals on the big screen are stunning; it's just that the story is a little weak. It doesn't have quite enough to bring the movie all the way to the finish line.Good Time has a run time of 1 hour and 40 minutes and it earns its strong \"R\" rating with plenty of violence, sex and drugs. When I go to a movie the first question I ask myself is, \"was it entertaining?\" Unfortunately that would include the entire movie. The final third of the film almost bored me to sleep.

The Drifters and later George Benson sang \"the neon lights are bright on Broadway\". Well, we aren't on Broadway, and though they aren't bright, the neon lights are ever present and crucial to the tone of the latest from brothers and co-directors Benny Safdie and Josh Safdie. Robert Pattinson stars as Connie Nikas, and turns in a performance unlike anything we have previously seen from him. Connie is protective of his brother Nick (played by director Benny Safdie), and he's also a grungy unhinged bank robber. He doesn't look like a man with a plan, but fortunately, Connie is a smooth talker who thinks 'quick on his feet'. We say fortunately, because he is barraged with an endless stream of danger, catastrophes and near traumatic events as the story progresses. A botched bank robbery separates the brothers and sends Nick to jail and Connie on the lam. Co-writers Ronald Bronstein and Josh Safdie seemingly take immense pleasure in sending Connie off-the-rails has he desperately attempts to avoid capture while simultaneously figuring out how to spring brother Nick. With a frenetic pace that escalates Griffin Dunne's misery in AFTER HOURS, Connie's escapades have him crossing paths with his girlfriend played by Jennifer Jason Leigh (wish she had more screen time), a psychiatrist played by Peter Verby, a new anxious-to-help acquaintance in Taliah Webster, an accidental partner-in-crime played by Buddy Duress, an amusement park security guard played by Barkhad Abdi (\"Look at me!\"), and a brutish thug played by hip-hop artist Necro.The pounding, pulsating techno/synth music perfectly complements the unusual tone (almost noirish, and bordering on comedic), feverish pace, and fascinating visuals throughout. Some viewers will be turned off quickly, and those that stick with it will be rewarded with an entertaining crime thriller featuring Pattinson's best performance to date."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Good Time is a small movie about small people doing small things. But never let it be said that it's dreary or dull. This movie somehow took the edgy anxiety of a waking nightmare, bottled it up, and put it on the screen so you'd leave the theater in a cold sweat. If the DVD/Blu-ray release of Good Time doesn't have a critic blurb saying \"this movie gave me indigestion,\" I'll be sorely disappointed.The setup is simple: a wanted man (Pattinson) tries to raise the money for bail to get his mentally handicapped brother (Safdie) out of prison. The two had held up a bank earlier that day and throughout the night, Connie resorts to dubious and dangerous lengths to avoid punishment and consequence.In an interview with NPR co-director and co-star Benny Safdie said \"We wanted to deliver a piece of pulp that actually felt dangerous.\" With that in mind cinematographer Sean Price Williams shot on 35mm and much of the movie is loaded with claustrophobic close-ups and delirious hand-held sweeps. The 35mm film bleeds into the New York nocturne. The punishing fluorescents and neon glints that makeup the movie's milieu taunts our protagonist as he spins his wheels round and round. It's a movie that recaptures the intimacy and intensity of a 4am sneak-about.Even in calmer moments, the film pulses in its nervy desperation. The various innocents the come across Connie's path are more-or-less looking for the same thing, a way out of the mess. They approach their situations with variant levels of legality but never with Pattinson's level of sleaze or sense of entitlement. Despite this, Connie proves remarkably resourceful; one minute his back is up against a corner, the next he's clawed his way out and slumping towards the next hurdle of his odyssey. One can't help but think that if Connie put his mind towards anything other than crime, he'd be on the cover of a business magazine.Instead he's in an unending fever dream whereby the urban sprawl is the water to his drowning rat. At its height, Good Time has the sparseness and clarity of a John Steinbeck novel and at its most pedestrian it still has the chaotic energy of The 25th Hour (2002)."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Good Time stars Robert Pattinson as a desperate criminal fresh off of a botched bank robbery that tries to free his accomplice brother from Rikers Island before he gets sent to general population. Written and Directed by The Safdie Brothers, Good Time is an exhilarating crime drama that brings back the grit that made these types of films so palpable and treats us to both a visual and emotional journey through the underbelly of NY.Starting off with the robbery and subsequent botching, Good Time starts off like a bullet train and doesn't let up for even a second. Centering on Rober Pattinson's Connie Nika, the film is a crime odyssey much in the vein of Scorsese's After Hours. This is a ticking time bomb of a film that brings Pattinson to his absolute best. Make no mistake, this is a master class performance from him. This is far from the performances he gives in sappy romance films. This is a fully realized performance that is bound to be talked about for years to come. But as great of a performance as he gives, the credit goes to the Safdie brothers' phenomenal script.The story of Good Time is very race-against-the-clock. But when broken down, this is a film about a desperate guy that wants to make a change. He doesn't want the hustle and bustle of NY, he wants a farm and his brother. He doesn't want to do bad things but he's willing to do it if it advances him to get to his brother. The whole story is centered around Love, much like their previous film Heaven Knows What. Love is a central theme in Good Time and it might be hard to decipher that through its gritty absolution but the end result will surely make you realize what really was important all along to Connie Nikas. It's a truly magnificent and heart pounding film that has surprising emotional heft to it. Overall, Good Time is a fantastic film that finally allows that NY grit back into the scene and really cranks up the tension while doing so. With a great script and an undeniably Oscar caliber performance from Robert Pattinson, Good Time ranks with the very best of the year."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Meet the Safdie Brothers, Josh and Ben. Oh, they've been making movies since they were kids in New York City and their films (starting with short films) have been seen in theaters since 2006, but it's the 2017 crime drama \"Good Time\" (R, 1:40) that serves as their introduction to a significant number of Movie Fans. Their films usually follow the misadventures and misdeeds of morally-challenged characters through various settings in New York's dark underbelly. Josh and Ben (sometimes, Joshua and Benny) often each pull at least double-duty when making their movies, in roles to include producer, director, writer, cinematographer, editor and actor. \"Good Time\" is no exception. Josh and Ben share directing duties, while Josh is also the film's co- writer (with Ronald Bronstein) and Ben (as \"Benny Safdie\") plays a key supporting role. The end result can be seen as difficult to watch, but it's hard not to be impressed with the skill the Safdie brothers demonstrate in their various roles \u2013 behind and in front of the camera. Nick Nikas (Benny Safdie) is a mentally-challenged man-child who lives with his grandmother. As the film opens, he is being evaluated by an elderly psychiatrist (Peter Verby) after unintentionally breaking his grandmother's arm. Nick alternates between emotional and non-communicative until his older brother, Constantine (Robert Pattinson), bursts into the room and pulls Nick out of the session over the stringent objections of the well-meaning psychiatrist. Constantine (who goes by Connie) assures Nick that he's the one with Nick's best interests at heart. The two talk about getting a place together where Nick dreams that he'll be able to \"do what I want, when I want.\" Connie loves his brother and sincerely wants to take care of him, but Connie can't even take care of himself. He's a manipulator whose moral compass lost its needle long ago \u2013 and the kind of guy who might find a four-leaf clover, right before the leaves fall off. Connie's idea of making his and Nick's lives better starts with the two of them attempting to rob a bank. In spite of impressive disguises and a plan that seems well thought-out (up to a point), the heist goes awry, the brothers get separated and Nick is arrested. Connie goes to see his girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and tries to coerce her into giving him the money for Nick's bail. In the meantime, a confused and stressed-out Nick gets beaten so badly by another prisoner that he ends up in the hospital. When Connie learns about this, even though his face is all over the news as one of the bank robbers, he boldly walks through the hospital hallways with the intention of spiriting his brother away. What follows is a series of Connie's mistakes, manipulations and misjudgments which bring him into contact with and endanger a teenage girl (Taliah Webster), a drug dealer (Buddy Duress), a security guard (Barkhad Abdi) and others who are affected by Connie's well-meaning, but misguided attempts to help his younger brother.\"Good Time\" is an ironically titled, intense and intelligent crime drama. It's dark in tone and visuals, while the framing of those visuals and the words spoken by the actors make the story uncomfortably personal. It's a raw and engaging window into the desperation of a single-minded, violent and slightly sympathetic loser. Pattinson's performance is disturbingly real, while Benny Safdie's is startling and emotionally sophisticated in its simplicity. Both performances are award-worthy \u2013 especially that of Safdie. Watching him on screen, I got the same feeling of awards season inevitability that I had when I first saw Christoph Waltz in \"Inglourious Basterds\" and Mark Rylance in \"Bridge of Spies\", both of which won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. But acting recognitions aside, this film is a work of art, like a dark, disturbing and hauntingly beautiful painting that you might wish hadn't captured your attention, but find yourself unable to turn away from until you have experienced everything it has to offer. It's difficult to call such a film \"entertaining\" (which is my main criterion for assigning a grade to a movie). The viewer won't have a \"good time\", per se, but will likely be impressed by the film's artistry. \"B+\""}, {"score": "1/10", "review": "One of the worst, laziest, illogical, empty films I have EVER seen.

In fact you may walk away hating the main character and you will have every right to. But damn, i'm proud of Robert Pattinson. He's joining that club of former YA actors like Daniel Radcliffe and Kristen Stewart who are pushing themselves when it comes to their independent film choices now. Credit should be given to the Safdie brothers, who I honestly don't know much about but this movie makes me want to look into their past work. You can tell they have a visual style. This is one of the grittiest looking thrillers to come out in a while and the way they have colors just pierce through the darkness and edginess just fuels this acid-induced thriller more. Every time these guys turn up the suspense this movie just grabs you by the cortex and never lets go. Part of that is the most kick ass musical score you've ever heard. This score is phenomenal, it is workout music times 100. But yeah, the reason this works so well is really Robert Pattinson. This is his best role ever. I know there are going to be teenage girls who are like \"noo\", but i'm saying yes, mostly because the dude is mostly making you have to like him through facial expressions alone.He plays a guy whose brother is mentally disabled and in order to get them both out of a shitty situation, he manipulates the brother into robbing a bank in which case the brother is arrested and he has to figure out a way to get him out of jail.And that Pattinson manages any sympathy at all is really something cause he does some seriously screwed up stuff in this movie, like try to seduce a 16 year old type badness. He's a scumbag and Pattinson never makes you lose sight of that but he's a character in a story with many scumbags and in the end his motivations are at least understandable. What hurts this movie a little more than you may not be totally behind the characters is the down time. Sometimes it's funny and sometimes its clever but it doesn't exactly have a story populated with enough ideas or action to constitute the run-time. So I go 7 out of 10 guys.

It just feels like a slice of life put on screen. Which is fine. It's just not as interesting as having a point of view."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "It's not often a film from this era manages to make me think of some of Scorsese's early features, but 'Good Time' does just that. Taking place in New York City, focusing on criminals, and presenting a bleak tone with a few black comedy laughs as well, director Ben Safdie is doing his best Scorsese impression without it feeling too homage-y. In fact, Scorsese is one of the first people listed in the thank you section of the credits.I think one of the critiques that 'Good Time' may receive is that it's too miserable and there never seems to be any light at the end of the tunnel. Take Robert Pattinson's lead character, Connie. He's the character we follow for most of the movie, and I'm not sure he makes a single decision that would be considered morally right. He's constantly trying to evade law-enforcement to get back to his brother who was arrested for robbing a bank with him. It's very difficult to root for someone with that type of mindset, but Pattinson winds up being someone who I didn't want to fail. Sometimes just taking a back seat and watching a film unfold is better than trying to attach yourself to characters are unlikable.One standout from 'Good Time' is the score by Daniel Lopatin. Much like Drive, Neon Demon, and the upcoming Blade Runner 2049, 'Good Time' tries to evoke a different era with its music. Lopatin's score feels like it's straight out of an 80's film. You wouldn't think it would work, but there's something some hauntishly thrilling about it, with an undertone of humanity that made it really effective. No wonder it won an award back at Cannes.Energetic, relentless, filled with great performances, and a brutally dark story. makes 'Good Time' one of the more interestingly unique films of 2017, and certainly one of the best directed. Evoking Scorsese's 70's films is a good start, but the film definitely makes its own imprint along the way.7.9/10"}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Robert Pattinson is pure perfection like you've never seen him before.

All of Connie's terrible decisions and horrific predicaments are in the pursuit of making his brother's dreams come true. Connie thinks he's doing what is best for Nick, but is completely deaf to other (professional) opinions. The whole movie focusing on such terrible situations made me want to walk out of the theater, but boy am I glad I didn't. The end is pure symphonious revelation. The conclusion is satisfyingly melancholy. About an hour 20 into this movie, I don't think I would've written the recommendation I'm about to write. This is an absolute must see. Everyone needs to explore such a truly human concept: He's doing all the wrong things, for the right reason. This film calls out your instincts in judging Connie by his hate-ability, when we all could essentially be him when backed into a corner. This film shows the darkest side of doing anything for the ones you love but also toys with the idea of redemption through sacrifice. If you want to be existentially shaken, this film is a bulls-eye.

When the heist goes wrong and Nick is captured by police, Connie fails to come up with the bail money. He decides that it'll just be easier to break his brother out of the hospital room in which he's being held.This film is a continuous cycle of \"bad to worse\". Connie is basically chewing his fingers off worrying about his brother. To him, nothing is too underhanded. He's willing, quick-witted, resourceful... but he's also been cursed with the Midas touch of sh*t and, let's face it, he's not all that intelligent. The man has a knack for finding people to prey upon. You'd feel bad when the situation blows up and he's the only one left unscathed... but it feels like their fate was an inevitability. It just happened a bit quicker thanks to our protagonist. You're nervous all the way through, but dumb criminals are such a joy to watch that you devour every moment with enthusiasm. I never knew what to expect out of \"Good Time\". Will Connie find some kind of redemption in the teenage girl (Talia Webster) he dupes into helping him? Will the innocent, naive bystander become a pawn or a victim? Whenever the crook encounters someone, you tense up. Even if you disregard the tight story that keeps you guessing, this is a great film. It's expertly shot, the use of music and the general tone give it a distinct identity. Then, there are the performances. Pattinson disappears in this unglamorous, but meaty and nuanced role. He's accompanied by many great moments courtesy of Jennifer Jason Leigh (in a small part), Barkhab Abdi (whom you'll remember from \"Captain Phillips\"), Buddy Duress as a criminal who forms a tenuous alliance with Connie as well as the aforementioned Ben Safdie and Taliah Webster. I never wanted the movie to end. I enjoyed seeing this seedy world that much.\"Good Time\" offers a slow, steady drip of thrills. You'll be sweating and, very frequently, laughing at the expense of people who are probably getting what was coming to them. There's also tenderness. At its core, this is a story about love, a poisonous love. It's another small film that you're going to have to look for, but wow is it worth the effort.

However staying on the note of performances it would be a total overlooking to not mention Benny Safdie's absolute knock out performance of mentally handicapped Nick. This performance easily rivals some of the greatest mentally handicapped renditions of all time. I wish we saw some more of Nick who kind of disappears till the very end of the movie after the first 30 minutes or so.Now that I've covered the performances let me get to the cinematography and score. Both of which are of very high quality. The original score is easily the best of the 2017 releases. The score is very effective in delivering the message of intensity and anxiety when things pick up.

It's frantic but sometimes mellow and blends dirtiness with the good intentions of Connie in a way that comes out really well.I'm giving the movie an 8, but its just short of a 9 which I'm not gonna give here due to the somewhat non-ending end and the lack of Benny's \"Nick\" after the first 30 minutes which I felt would have lent to the tone of the film if every now and then as Connie was struggling to get things done we saw brief scenes of Nick continuing to have a hard time in jail here and there.Go out and buy a ticket to this movie and support this kind of cinema because it deserves it."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "\"Good Time\" is a twisted bank heist film that definitely proves two things - one, Robert Pattinson's versatility as an actor ; two, the Safdie brothers' unique and creative style of direction.Robert Pattinson shines brightly in his role as the stubble-laden, nervy criminal in this movie who attempts to rob a bank with his brother.

Two brothers rob a bank, run from the police, and one ends up in the hospital. Then it gets worse.Constantine (played by Robert Pattinson, in a career-making performance) lives a life of dysfunction. He struggles to maintain healthy relationships with family or friends or anyone. The one thing in his life that he's sure of is that he wants to take care of his brother, who has intellectual disabilities. He spends a majority of the film frantically (frantic accurately describes the mood for most of Good Time) attempting to save his brother from the trouble that he put him in. The problem is that Constantine can't even properly take care of himself, so helping his brother is far beyond his abilities.Try as he may, every attempt to help backfires. Despite Constantine's good intentions, he is a powerfully negative influence in his brother's life. He sees himself as his brother's savior, but that's very far from the truth.It's tempting to sympathize with Constantine. He has real moments of decency. But just when you may think this isn't such a bad guy, he showcases another instance of unsavory behavior. That seems to be the story of his life\u2014fleeting moments of hope, followed by swift slaps of grim reality that are mostly brought on by his own doing.In the end, his brother, Nick, becomes the more likable character. We want what is best for Nick, just like Constantine does. Because of this shared goal, I want Constantine to succeed. I have never rooted harder for a character that I didn't really want to root for. That's all because of Nick.Since this is sounding deeply dramatic, let me reiterate, this isn't a plodding sob story. The frantic pace, ludicrously rousing music and color scheme will make your eyes bug out and your hair stand up. Actually, you may literally stand up at certain moments because of the intensity.See Good Time if you're up for an intense crime thriller. Just don't forget to think while watching. There's more to this movie than neon and techno."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "'GOOD TIME': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new stylized heist genre flick from directors Ben and Josh Safdie; Josh also co-wrote the script with Ronald Bronstein (the trio performed the same duties on 2014's 'HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT'). Ben also costars in the movie with Robert Pattinson, Buddy Duress, Taliah Webster,Jennifer Jason Leigh and Barkhad Abdi. The film tells the story of two brothers that rob a New York bank together, but things go horribly wrong when the younger brother (who's mentally handicap) is caught and taken into custody by the police. His older brother will then desperately do anything to get him out of prison. It's received rave reviews from critics, and it also premiered at the main competition of the 2017 Cannes Film Festival; where electronic musician Oneohtrix Point Never's score won the Best Soundtrack award (Iggy Pop collaborated on a track as well). The movie is now playing in indie theaters, and I absolutely loved it!Connie Nikas (Pattinson), and his mentally handicap brother Nick (Safdie), rob a New York bank together. They appear to get away with several thousand dollars of cash, until a dye pack goes off in one of their bags, and causes their getaway driver to crash his car. Connie and Nick flee the crash scene on foot, but they're stopped by police for questioning. Nick panics and runs, so Connie follows. Connie is able to evade capture, but Nick is caught and arrested. Fearing for his brother's safety, Connie desperately tries to get enough bail money together to get his brother out of prison. When Connie finds out that Nick was taken to a hospital, after being beaten in a prison fight, Connie attempts to break him out. He mistakes another criminal (Duress) for his brother though, and things keep getting worse from there. The movie is so surprisingly fresh and unique, that I can't help but rave about it. It's stylized in a familiar genre way, but the story and characters are so original and different (than almost any other film out there), that you can't help but be completely captivated by every minute of it. The characters are mostly unlikable, and the entire setting is pretty depressing and disturbing, but the film leaves a very memorable impression by it's conclusion. Pattinson also gives arguably the best performance of his career (and I remember when I use to think he was a horrible actor), plus the soundtrack is also totally awesome and classic as well! I think this film is definitely worth seeing, that's for sure.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/PdeLWCp_JrI"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Connie and Nick are brothers, but their ties are not limited to genetics. They are a symbiotic swirl of aggression and possibility. Together the two are impaired with an uncanny blindness. Barriers disappear and strangers' murmurs fizzle out. Their wild, dirt-etched plans are carried out with ferocity and total abandon. Running is their pastime, and they have become proficient dodgers. Nick is viewed as a liability to society, and Connie is labeled as a danger to it. Newscasters reduce them to mugshots and sensational teleprompter poetry. The city needs villains. The cops need robbers. The pubic needs faces to fear. The brothers need to get to Virginia.Not a single soul can decipher the calamity in Nick's head, not even Connie. A therapist chisels away at his cranium only to discover that Nick was raised in the wilderness. The professional world clashes with the feral, urban ghetto in a nauseating office. Connie fends off the emotional combat for his brother. Huddled in the corner of a descending elevator, he assures Nick that no one understands their pain.They steal rather than earn; fight rather than accommodate. They are devoted brutes, writhing in uncontrollable suspicion. Sensitive to blue and red streams, and terrified of separation. Meandering upon steam-breathing streets like amputated Siamese twins. Their conjoined heart palpitates with neon intensity.Connie has been educated by the cruelty of the city. The assaults upon his brother have toned his muscles and sharpened his wit. He is the unstoppable force that causes officers to be armed. He transcends the status of guardian. Connie is a fable of determination. His good deeds are shadowed by his actions, but his actions are birthed from his compassion. \u200bThe brother's story is an expose on the concept of \"good\". Maybe we should redefine righteousness, and leave room for desperate souls. An \"us versus them\" mentality erodes the potential kindness of strangers. Connie subverts all social norms in route towards securing his brother's salvation. On this pilgrimage, a restless city tosses in its bed as a two brothers attempt to steal back their birthright of happiness."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "It was a hot morning in a NYC apartment and I suddenly got the interest to see a movie that day before taking the Amtrak train back home. The film I saw was Good Time, starring Robert Pattinson. It was a sad but an edge of your seat wild ride. From start to finish you are wondering what the hell is going to happen and how will the problem be resolved. It has a fantastic score and every actor in the film plays their role perfectly. If you ware in the mood for a good edge of your seat flick definitely check this picture out."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "I had never been more excited to see a film after viewing the trailer, and as soon as my local theater showed it (only for a short time, it's a shame, really), I jumped at the opportunity to see it. In fact, I decided to watch it a second time just two days after my first viewing. I don't hesitate to say that this is my absolute favorite movie of the year. This was my first Safdie Brothers film, and it was brilliantly done.Good Time delivered a very engaging and nail-biting story line. The camera work and background music was so well done that it effectively slowed and quickened the pace when (I'm speculating) it was needed. Robert Pattinson took this role to a whole new level, and he has never failed to impress me with his acting.Essentially, you're enveloped in a neon world with characters that are nothing short of real. Words can't describe the flurry of emotions that rushed through me. The story itself is so raw and harsh, and as you watch, every obstacle the main character encounters snowballs, and every single time, it's a thrill. Needless to say, it will never allow you to feel bored, leaving you wishing there was more to it. I believe though, that that's the beautiful thing about this movie. For anyone who might say that this movie was too spontaneous or confusing, I believe you missed the fact that this movies emulates life as it is. Life in and of itself is spontaneous.\"You're gonna have a good time.\""}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Good Time, written and directed by Benny and Josh Safdie is simply amazing. From the story and neon drenched color palette Good Time is something similar to a sleazy, grimy late night crime stories in the 70's and 80's. But, while the visuals are fantastic to look at the greatest strength Good Time has going for it is the cast. The two brothers, played by director Benny Safdie and Roberts Pattinson are of course the stand outs. The opening scene with Benny's character Nick slowly breaking down into tears is a powerful cold open. Pattinson's erratic Connie is so well acted that you feel Connie's brain going a mile a minute in a effort to help his brother. In the end I would wager money Good Time will be making many, many top ten lists for this year and I can't think of a more deserving movie."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Few films have such an ironic title as 'Good Time'. A more fitting title would have been 'Murphy's Law'. Anything that possibly could go wrong, goes wrong.In this case, the law applies to Connie, a tough and streetwise New Yorker. Het robs a bank with his mentally handicapped brother Nick, who gets caught soon after. By trying to get the money for his brother's bail, Connie gets himself in deep trouble. His situation goes from bad to worse. Some of the predicaments he gets himself in, are sad and funny at the same time. He stumbles from one seemingly hopeless situation into another, but with some luck and a lot of guts he can escape most of them.A large part of the film takes place during the night time, which gives it a special character. The cinematography shows a neon-lit urban landscape, filmed in a nervous style, corresponding with Connie's state of mind. The soundtrack full of sinister music adds to the gloomy atmosphere. The Safdie brothers, one of whom also plays the part of the handicapped brother, have shown to be very talented directors.The interesting thing is that viewers will have no problem identifying with Connie. Although he is a criminal and a hoodlum, the ultimate motivation for his acts is the love for his brother. He has to get the money for his brother's bail, and that's the reason to forgive him for his less noble acts. 'I am better than you', he tells another criminal at one point. At first this seems preposterous, because at that point Connie seems to be the ultimate loser. But then you realize he's right: there is a deeper motivation for his acts than just foolishness.In the end Connie becomes more and more desperate, and throughout the film you know that this can't end well. But it does: although he doesn't succeed in his goal and has to face defeat in the end, the very last scene of the film is a very hopeful one. It adds to the theme of moral ambiguity that gives this movie an extra dimension."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "I've been a fan of the Sadfie Bros since Heaven Knows What. This was a moving film about a night with some real characters. .especially liked seeing Buddy Duress. It's worth a watch, it's gritty, fast-paced and intense. All about Robert Pattinson trying to help his brother. I was not a Pattinson fan before this. I abhor twilight-refuse to see it. But, his performance here was riveting. Very believable. Plus lots of shots of NYC, the Sadfie's style immediately caught me from Heaven Knows What. This film almost seemed like it could be in the same universe as that. It draws you in from the opening scene, and doesn't let up. Jennifer Jason Leigh's supporting role was intense as well. I truly hope to see more from these director's."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "I thought this was a great movie. It's very entertaining and well acted. It's soundtrack is a bit heavy on the 80's synths, very similar to Stranger Things in fact, but overall I think this works well and adds to the feel of the film. The only downside I would give this movie is the final scene, I think the director got this wrong, I think he was trying too hard to make a moment in the final scene and it detracted from the character involved in that scene and actually annoyed me."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "I thoroughly enjoyed this film on several levels. The acting, direction and story line were all done extremely well. It was original and there is an element of commitment of love through the forced negative acts of the desperate protagonist.I also have to say I enjoyed the psychedelic score which worked well with the pace of the film. Last, I grew up in the neighborhood much of the film is shot in so I am somewhat biased. This, however, is not what makes the film so good.Pattinson is brilliant as the Big brother trying to make a better life for himself and his learning disabled brother. A bank robbery they attempt goes wrong and the remainder of the film is an attempt to recover his brother from a hospital after getting caught and beat up in jail. I won't give any more away but have to say the film is thought provoking, exciting and fast paced. I also felt it was quite realistically done in the way each character plays their parts. The only thing I found annoying was the credits ran into 22+ minutes of the film. Otherwise, a tremendous effort and success for the Safdie Brothers."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "Violence pays...but how much ? The whole movie is about making money in the old-fashioned gangsta style manner ...I didn't enjoy all the twists from bad to wrong , the unnecessary array of violence , the script has so many flaws and drawbacks that even Tarantino or the Cohen brother couldn't improve it. A movie about desperate , moronic under-dogs screwing up their lives in the pursuit of blood money . Nevertheless , there's a plus to the grim and debilitating mood of the movie : Robert Pattinson's great performance and the music. Otherwise , a deja-vu of clich\u00e9s and an unpleasant waste of time !"}, {"score": "1/10", "review": "In all my life I haven't seen such a pathetic production of what they seem to think is a movie of good entertainment. Rookie actors who can't act to save their lives. Pathetic scripting. Total lack of any quality whatsoever. After watching this movie for 10 minutes, I couldn't stomach watching such garbage again. I have approx. 5000 movies and 3000 other films in my collection. I can definitely assure you that this one will be thrown out with the rest of garbage around here. What a waste of money.How much did this movie cost to make. My guess looking at the quality of filming, the actors and production, maybe about $100. Because I wouldn't pay any of those actors based on their pathetic understanding of what a really good actor can achieve. Not even one \"A\" class actor. I have a collection of \"B\" rated movies. Compared to your production, my \"B\" rated movies are high class.Seriously guys, if your going to make a movie, try to come up with something that people can appreciate as good entertainment. Try to find an actor who doesn't think the movie is about him. Trying to act cool on camera is an art, a true talent to get it right. Just look at actors like, \"Tom Hanks\", \"Tom Cruise\", \"Morgan Freeman\". These guys know how to act cool and do it very well. Your people suck.!! Spend a few extra dollars next time and just maybe you may get it right, but I sincerely doubt it looking at the quality of your past work.My Rating is 0."}]
