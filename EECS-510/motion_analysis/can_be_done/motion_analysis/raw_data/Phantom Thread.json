But my opinion is this movie is even better than the first one .And i think most of us will admit this.Why it is a classic?I am referring it to a Classic as this movie has every answer to all of the critics. The plot is centered around a renowned dressmaker of Fashion era of 1950 in London.The movie has successfully shown the fashion types and patterns of London in 1950. It has all the classical designs of high society and it is very much amusing to see those in 2017.Next the entry of a perfect quetie in the form of Vicky crieps. She has filmed the role of a glamorous women with all glows perfectly.Her dressing, impressions, expressions and activities around her own beauty is so eye soothing that it has added an extra flavour.Now the main part of the movie which is an unequal affair between the dressmaker and the young lady. Their strong will, intense romance, breathless moments of pure expression all set in the fashion era of 1950 is very much mindblowing. The rest of the film is a real set piece to enjoy.Daniel Day-Lewis is as excellent as ever in the central role. Direction is always perfect when Paul Thomas Anderson has responsibility of performing it.When we say classic it reminds us \"Godfather\" or may be \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and so on. But you have to add this movie to that list surely.May be a fourth Oscer is coming for Daniel Day- Lewis....You never know....May be...."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "This is the most unique romance film to come out in all of history. Paul Thomas Anderson has struck Gold again with this masterpiece. The Screenplay is really original and very engaging. Usually when people watch a film, they tend to doze off at times because of slow moments. This film however, you cannot look away, you cannot blink because the timeless beauty and sheer elegance that this film has is unparalleled. What keeps you so engaged is the breathtaking cinematography shot on a 35mm camera, the Stand out performances from Daniel Day Lewis , and Vicky Kriceps and also the amazing dialogue which keeps you drowned in the film. Many people might think ''Oh its a movie about the love story of a dressmaker''so they might not watch it. If you feel that way, its your loss to miss this masterpiece of a film. It is a suspenseful romance film which has never been done before and the fact that you cannot look away from the screen, it proves that this film is the best film of 2017. This film is going to be mentioned for years to come. Just like ''There Will Be Blood'', it will be shown in film classes to learn from and just like ''There Will Be Blood''it will be mentioned as one of the best films of all time. As this is Daniel Day Lewis's last role, i can say that it is worth being called a movie worthy of Daniel Day Lewis's last. In fact, It is his best film to date and in terms of performance, he gives one of the best of his career. I would not be surprised if he wins best Actor for this one over Gary Oldman. Day Lewis totally deserves to be the only actor to have 4 Oscars. If Vicky Criceps is not nominated for Best supporting actress or best actress then we know that the Oscars are unreliable, She equally matches Day Lewis in terms of performance and that is saying a lot because she is working with one of the best. Paul Thomas Anderson continues his legacy in film with this epic, and he deserves a nomination for best director, if not, he deserves a win. This film is one of the best to come out in the past 5 years and i could say its perfect.

The frustration by any form of interruption by anything or anyone out of place guarantees his private isolation and yet he craves the warmth of human intimacy. The complexity of Ryan Woodcock becomes totally accessible in Daniel Day Lewis's eyes, with every move, with every silence. It is a monumental, beautiful creation.

He's always been extremely careful and creative with the material that he is given. But sometimes he can not always deliver. His recent film being inherent vice, which was massively disappointing. But this new film of his, Phantom Thread is stupendous. The movie works like a snake; Playing on your instincts. This movie left me star-stuttered. Paul Thomas Anderson, like all of his movies, even the bad ones, have great direction. He has an amazing way of presenting gratifying content. You always get glued to the screen. Also the cinematography is spectacular. Paul Thomas Anderson always has Robert Elswit. But this time he has the helm of cinematographer himself. And it's pretty good actually. I actually would've preferred Robert Elswit himself, because even though the cinematography is great, it isn't spectacular. Also the writing is great as well, of course. Paul Thomas Anderson has great scripts. I really like the way he writes his movies, it's really amazing. But this might be his best written and directed movie since boogie nights and the master, two of my favourite Paul Thomas Anderson movies. The acting is also exceptional, especially from Daniel Day Lewis who carries the movie. Is acting is marvelous. And the rest of the acting is also great. The sudden, scary, relentless relationship between Daniel Day Lewis' character and Vicky Krieps' character is really moving. You get to see these characters grow and learn from each other. And really, the two main lead roles are fantastic as characters, in term's of how these characters are set-up. The music is actually where my problems lie. The music is constantly nodding you off to sleep. It's the most boring, drifting, lazy score I've heard this year. Usually Paul Thomas Anderson doesn't have good music in his movies which is a shame. Anyway the Phantom Thread is a great movie, definitely one of the best movies of the year. This is Daniel Day Lewis' last role and he knocks it out of the park with this one.

This movie, in contrast, is a lampoon of those 1930s and 1940s movies in which someone suffers endlessly for some selfish artistic a**hole, dying of Dread Movie Disease in the 7th reel and looking more beautiful than ever, while the artist conducts his symphony or receives the applause at the premiere of his play; the protagonist is unnoticed save for the Vitaphone Orchestra and perhaps the Hall Johnson choir. Then, just as it is getting a little too long and self-indulgent, the movie switches gears. And does it again. All in that beautiful Technicolor lighting you got in Great Britain on prints that were a bit too dark.... thanks to uncredited cinematographer Paul Thomas Anderson.There's no reason this should be to your taste; large sections of it, about Vicky Krieps suffering because she loves Day-Lewis so much, and he, despite his occasional heterosexual activity (about like Donald Westlake's Parker) cares for nothing but making beautiful dresses and the memory of his dead mother, were not to mine.

Daniel Day-Lewis, probably the best actor alive today finally returns in what is said to be his final film. Paul Thomas Anderson, one of the most consistent directors today comes back for another exciting film this time a period piece set in 1950s London. It was impossible not to get excited for this. I haven't seen Hard Eight, but I think I love everything else I've seen from PTA, he is a fantastic filmmaker who deserves more praise than he gets. I think Phantom Thread may be his magnum opus (though I need to assess this for sure).The film is about an esteemed dressmaker (played by Day-Lewis) who makes dresses for the cream of the crop. Things change very soon for him when he falls for a waitress named Alma. She becomes a part of his life and though he is a fixed man of routine her ways make him question himself, his love and their relationship. The film also shows some of the ups (and mostly the downs) of their relationship, and how volatile things become. The film examines the relationships between the two and the effects that ripple over time.This film is superb on a few fronts. I don't think its Daniel Day-Lewis's best performance, although that's even hard to assess because the roles he does are so different. DDL's Reynolds Woodcock is a fixed, brutally honest, snotty man who clashes heavily with his wife who challenges him and is not content with standing by his side and remaining quiet. The back and forth between the two is a joy to behold. The scene at the surprise dinner has some of the best dialogue you will see this year. I can't commend the cast enough on their performances. Vicky Krieps has just put her name out there with this effort.The cinematography and score are also of the highest order. I think this film is a strong contender for the Oscar for costume design as the costumes are gorgeous and impeccably immaculate. This is a vibrant and gorgeous picture in mind and in visuals. There are hardly any dull moments and the film flies by. PTA also masters comedy in this picture, there is enough levity to contrast the films more serious moments. Overall, this film is worth all the hype and praise its received. Its probably the best we've seen from Anderson and a wonderful swan song for Daniel Day-Lewis (if this remains to be the case). There are many strong films this year and I think Phantom Thread is up there with some of the very best. All around memorable film that is breathtakingly stunning.8.5/10"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Intimate, delicate, and a beautifully crafted masterpiece. Paul Thomas Anderson manages to expresses an artist's creative journey through threads of fashion and romance with such subtlety that it could only be conveyed through the medium of film. An atmosphere reminiscent of Kubrick's achievements, this romantic odyssey illustrates a unique perspective of love; a perspective in which love is shaped and manipulated by the fragile strings of each character's hearts.\n  To begin with, I will praise an awfully disregarded aspect of \"Phantom Thread\": the cinematography and direction. The style and manner in which Paul Thomas Anderson uses silence and long takes is ingenious, and as stated above, was most likely inspired from Kubrick's works. Similar to the quote, \"The less you say, the more your words will matter,\" the more silence, the more each line will signify. The more long takes, the more each short take will signify. Therefore, this method permits a greater control over the variety of dramatic effects; and in turn, the audience's emotions. Anderson also utilized this technique in many of his other films, including \"The Master\", \"Magnolia\", and his masterpiece, \"There Will Be Blood\".\n  Of course, this strategy doesn't always serve well. The more the audience regards the dialogue, the more engaging the screenplay has to be. The more engaging the screenplay is, the more compelling the performances have to be.\n  Yet \"Phantom Thread\" has all of this. Magnificent lead performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps, a strong and often overlooked supporting performance by Lesley Manville, and a sharp, dense original screenplay written by Paul Thomas Anderson himself. A few sprinkles of comedy are also blended in the script, which is always valuable for a romance. Not to forget the costume design either, which was essential to establish a post-war 1950s London environment. \n  And finally, the score. Arguably the strongest part of the film, the score possesses Paul Thomas Anderson's signature strange aura that is found in several of his other films. It's not a coincidence that one of his most frequent collaborators is Jonny Greenwood, who composed the score for this film, \"There Will Be Blood\", and many others. While most movies nowadays would use music to heighten drama, Paul Thomas Anderson rejects the common norm; valuing music to form an atmosphere. This atmosphere is crucial in almost all of his works, creating an eerie tone for a mystery that drives the story forward.\n  A transcendental and sublime work of art so remarkably subtle- delicately transfixing the audience ever so slightly, exploring the convoluted depths of an artist's obsession, and expanding cinema's horizons for miles of wonder- all woven beneath the intertwined threads of the phantom.\n  Farewell, Daniel Day-Lewis. We will miss you."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Every stitch of the filmmaking (the directing, the photography, the screenplay, the acting, the exquisitely beautiful music from Jonny Greenwood) mirrors the careful threading of fabric and creations of the film's focus: 1950's London dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock (played perfectly by Daniel Day Lewis). But writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson flips things on their head by making the new love interest, Alma (an amazing Vicky Krieps), the protagonist...and her emotional chess match with Reynolds creates the film's beautiful, subdued, classy, and darkly humorous suspense.Fans of refined cinema should rejoice. Phantom Thread is a carefully constructed and mesmerizing masterpiece. It is both unlike anything we've seen before from Paul Thomas Anderson and everything you could hope for from such a talent (the underlying themes carry across from other works, and the attention to detail remains paramount).

This delicate and utterly elegant period drama about a fictional tailor known as Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel-Day Lewis) relationship with a young woman played by Vicky Krieps. From its first frames, it is clear that PTA has paid sublime attention to detail with this film. Each scene feels truly finely crafted with a level of intense precision uncommonly found in even sophisticated filmmaking today. The sets, costumes and score are simply masterful and well worth the price of admission alone. From a somewhat more tangible standpoint, Anderson's drama further delivers the goods. The acting is very strong, as the film's performances can feel slightly subdued and low-key before creeping up on the viewer to create a sharp but simple impact. The movie's script is a delight, managing to pull of a genuine hat-trick by feeling both simple and complex at the same time. With a tone reminiscent of a classical romantic drama with Gothic and even some Shakespearean undertones, the tightly but grippingly paced drama that unfolds is both entertaining and enthralling for its audience. While PTA's films are not always known for their senses of humor, \"Phantom Thread\" is surprisingly very funny at times. The film's use of irony is also immensely clever, as dramatic and situational irony are both used in clever and impactful manners--both when the audience most and least expects them to arrive and occur. While some might criticize the film for being slightly slow at times, patient viewers will find much to savor--and commend--here.

There is a certain feeling that envelops me while experiencing exquisite filmmaking. It's a singular blend of peacefulness and excitement as an anticipation of greatness builds in those early scenes. That feeling has rarely swept over me as quickly as the opening moments of this new film from writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson, a six-time Oscar nominee.We need only watch Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) go through his morning ritual to understand that he is a fastidious individual to the point that could easily be described as obsessive-compulsive. It's 1955 London, and this is the House of Woodcock. He lives and works in a home that serves as the canvas for his art, as well as a place to lay his head for sleep. His art is dressmaking. It's also his obsession and purpose for living. This is the story of a man with transformative talent, who, despite his stated lack of need for those outside his solitary realm, is dragged into the humanity of love and caring.This is an odd film about odd people. It's about a dressmaker and it features people making beautiful clothes ... yet it's not a fashion movie. No, this is the study of a genius man and his muse - who is also his lover - and their unconventional saga of love. It's also a consistently funny movie (and surprisingly so). Evidence that that 3 will always be a crowd, Woodcock's devoted sister and buttoned-up business partner Cyril (a terrific Leslie Manville) runs a tight ship, while simultaneously using her near preternatural ability to read his moods and idiosyncrasies and respond accordingly. He refers to her as \"my old so-and-so\" in a way that reflects a lifelong bond unlikely to be broken.The woman who prevents this from simply being a story of a reclusive genius is the aforementioned muse Alma (played by the effervescent Vicky Krieps). Is she his muse, a model, or his lover? Well, yes to all. And yet those labels fall short in describing the subtleties and nuances of their relationship. When does she play which role in order to maintain the balance so key to his work? Alma is often confused about the best approach in any moment, but she reaches him as none before. When she tells Woodcock that a certain client \"doesn't deserve your dress\", it strikes a chord with him that no one else has ever understood. It's as close to 'getting him' as one can attain.Ms. Krieps goes toe-to-toe with Daniel Day-Lewis in their scenes. He is simply the greatest living actor, and maybe the best ever at his profession. Her blushy cheeks and determined eye of observation bely an inner strength that isn't necessarily obvious at first glance. The twist in this \"romance\" is unlike any other love story from the big screen. While he is haunted by the memories of a cherished mother, Alma presents a more immediate force of reckoning. Is she his tender savior or a menace of danger? It's fascinating to watch this unfold.Most know by now that Daniel Day-Lewis has announced this will be his final acting role. We can only compare this to the retirements of Sandy Koufax or Jim Brown. We feel cheated by the void of greatness left by their departures, and if this is truly his final role, the DDL legacy is supremely secure. His meticulous performance shines not only through the quirky OCD moments, but even moreso in the seemingly spontaneous moments of bickering and annoyance ... moments that come across ad-libbed instead of scripted - these sound (and feel) like real life arguments!Supposedly, filmmaker Anderson based the character on Spanish-Basque designer Cristobal Balenciaga, and Day-Lewis research added other elements of authenticity. It's their first movie together since the fantastic THERE WILL BE BLOOD ten years ago, and theirs seems to be a synchronicity that few actors and directors ever share. Mr. Anderson shot the movie himself, and his use of close-ups - faces, fingers, sewing needles - capture the delicacies as well as the power. The final piece of this glorious puzzle is the orchestral score provided by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood. It's both prominent and intricate, with stunning piano work that stands on its own. This is a movie about greatness by those who are also great."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Lewis's gaze upon the female 'objects' of his affection has become his signature technique.

So why only a 7? Well, I remember reading about how DDA and PTA were obsessively involved in the script and the production; I was surprised that Day-Lewis did not get a writing credit. Although the script did have some some nice turns of phrase and a few smiles, there was no there, there. The plot was thin as weak broth, and confusing in parts. My point is this: if you go to see this movie go for the beauty, go for the acting but don't expect a plot that is worthy of the excellence of all else cataloged above. And then I think the reason is that Day-Lewis and Anderson wound up talking just to each other living in their own universe and creating this for themselves without thinking of what we would think about the plot and the characters.

Yet, for those who possess and open mind to witness the unconventional transformation of the two protagonists Woodcock (Day Lewis) and Alma (Vicky Krieps) luscious surprises await, not the least of which are the gestures of appreciation and jealousy they wreak on each other. The structure of the story brings to light all the internal conflicts within ourselves, the seemingly conflicting feelings and urges of loving someone, growing increasingly jealous of them, and needing the other to love and appreciate us all collide in sequences of unexpected-- but perfectly executed-- scenes of mutual quips turned insults, leading up to understanding and acceptance of these very contradicting qualities. Less abstraction would reveal key details of the plot, but all I'll say is that this emotional pendulum between the two protagonists is wonderful to watch and supplies much fodder for future (self) analysis.The performances are fantastic, across the board. Aside for the two leads who nail each gesture, eye shift, and facial expression of their characters, Lesley Manville (who plays Cyril, Mr. Woodcock's sister) is particularly fantastic.

A couture dress designer (Daniel Day Lewis) is demanding in the extreme and finds a muse (Vicky Krieps). He enjoys using her as a dress model and a companion, but she wants more. Along the way, the director, Paul Thomas Anderson, throws hints of intrigue starting with the title of the film. There are empty pretensions of dress-making as high art, secret messages sown into dresses and haunting memories. All of this leads to- exactly nowhere. Everything Lewis and Krieps do is recorded lovingly and meticulously on film with great mood music in the background. But there is no great reveal, no deep insight into human psyche, no higher truth. In the end it comes down to what a woman wants and what the man can live with. Lewis and Krieps are excellent, especially Krieps, but Lesley Manville as Lewis's sister has the thankless job of looking stern in every scene. Nothing in the film sticks with you when you leave the theater except the dresses, photography and the music; because Anderson has not come up with anything really interesting in the story.

Moreover this allegedly will be the final performance of Daniel Day-Lewis' brilliant career. I say allegedly because similar rumors surrounded Lincoln, but given his famous selectivity regarding films, I am inclined to believe him and if this is truly his final performance, bravo on an unimpeachable career, sir (he won't read this).This is a splendid film and one of the most captivating experiences I have had at a movie theater in quite some time. From scene one to the final, not a single person left the theater, not a single person talked or cracked a joke, and nobody took out their phone. An entire theater of people, singularly invested in what was on the screen. That is rare nowadays... even more rare when it comes to movies about dresses.The credit for this phenomenon is all round. Let's start with the performers.Although there are great supporting characters to be found here, particularly from Leslie Manville's performance as Reynold's stoic but well-mannered assistant, Cyril, this is a story about the relationship between two people: Reynolds Woodcock and Alma. Reynolds Woodcock is one of the mid-twentieth century's greatest dress-makers, his greatness brought about by his fiercely stringent routine and slavish devotion to his craft over any personal relationships. After a particularly stressful day he makes a solo sojourn to a diner where he meets Alma. There, they immediately take an interest in each other. Alma is a polite and self-conscious woman who immediately allows herself to become vulnerable in the confident-if-demanding arms of Reynolds.I hesitate to call this film a \"romance\" or a \"love story.\" I rather refer to the relationship between Reynolds and Alma as a great game: a game to see which one of them will get the other to make the necessary changes in order for their relationship to either become stronger, or fall apart. Reynolds is detached, possibly out of fear of falling in love or ruining his routine, possibly not. Alma's newfound sense of self-worth drives her to break down the rigid shell of Reynolds in order for him to prioritize her more. Again this may be because she is in love with him, or maybe she has never gotten close enough to another man to know how a relationship works, or maybe she secretly has the same need for power and control that Reynolds does, and not having it is maddening to her. All things are possibilities and there are infinite more.I am using words like \"possibly\" a lot when describing the feelings and motivations of the characters here, and it's because this movie doesn't give you answers, and that's what makes it challenging, and therefore worth seeing. You will see these characters develop, you will see them argue, you will see them get along, you will see them exhibit coldness to one another, you will see them exhibit love and you will see them make some incredible decisions on their mutual-yet-connected journeys. However at no point will you be spoon-fed. Instead you will have to ask yourself: \"what the hell are they thinking?\" and be fine when you have to figure it out yourself. This film doesn't even answer the question of whether either of these people actually love one another. The most it does is show that to some extent, they learn to understand one another.Daniel Day-Lewis is at his typical level of brilliance here. He perfectly plays the role of an obsessive personality, who is so averse to letting someone interfere with his work, yet who more and more, through both natural and artificial means, also doesn't want to lose the new woman in his life. It was a challenging role, with the need for confidence, intensity, comedic timing, physical and mental weakness at times, nonverbal communication and everything in between. If this ultimately becomes the framework for the definitive Daniel Day-Lewis performance, it will be earned.However, I need to give a special shout-out to someone who was previously unknown to me, Vicky Krieps as Alma. She was given a difficult role to perform: she needed to have moments of vulnerability, confidence, sadness and glee. She needed to have both moments of submissiveness and vindictiveness and she had to make every second of her growth believable while acting alongside one of the most esteemed actors of all time. And she nailed it.Only elevating the performances, Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is superb here. The film is lengthy, but not a single frame of 70mm film is wasted (and that's a good thing because that stuff is freaking expensive. Seriously those projectors are like tens of thousands of dollars each. The Alamo is one of the few theaters that has one and my ticket would've been like 23 bucks if it wasn't my birthday. Oh yeah, the movie).Every moment of the film serves to advance the story. It's a slow burn, but you are always moving forward, and that is the important thing. The pace is consistently moving and therefore even though there are no time jumps or action scenes, it never gets boring. There is some damn stylish camera work here to boot, but it doesn't come off as pretentious. Pretentious is when M. Night Shyamalan says \"Hey look what I can do\" by trying to do a single-shot fight scene in The Last Airbender. When Paul Thomas Anderson does a single shot of Reynolds leaving his comfort zone while trying to find Alma (a woman who he still doesn't know how he truly feels about) at a crowded ball, you feel every level of his conflict. Everything from the beautiful imagery, to the spectacular camera work, to the authentic period representation, to the deliberate pacing and certainly to the career defining-performance of one lead, and the career-making performance of another, combine to make a delightful theater-going experience.Oh and the ending is brilliant.See it in 70mm if there is a theater near you with the capability."}, {"score": "5/10", "review": "While the movie was well acted and well put together with interesting camera work and novel use of even the most mundane sounds (such as the amplified scraping of butter on toast transforming the scene at breakfast), a character study simply does not work if you can't relate to the characters.

The movie costars Vicky Krieps and Lesley Manville, and it's also the director's fourth collaboration with music composer Jonny Greenwood. The film was shot in Lythe, England, marking Anderson's first movie filmed outside of the US, and it was also shot without an official cinematographer (Anderson says it was a collaborative effort). The movie has gotten nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's also been nominated for a shitload of prestigious awards as well. I really enjoyed it. The story is set in 1950s London, when Reynolds Woodcock (Day-Lewis) is a famous dressmaker who dresses all of society's wealthiest and most elite women. He's also a bachelor, who lives with his sister Cyril (Manville), and the two siblings are lifelong business partners. Reynolds has had many girlfriends, who briefly enter his life, but then he quickly rejects them. That is until he meets Alma (Krieps), who disrupts his obsessive and routine life to it's core.The film is slow-paced but it's still always interesting and involving. Day-Lewis is once again amazing in the lead, and he also once again portrays a very unlikable leading man character, but we still end up rooting for him (or at least I did). Even more so I rooted for Alma though, who's also beautifully played by Krieps, but what's most fascinating about the movie is what a beautiful love story it is. The film also beautifully shows us how love conquers all, even in really dark obsessive ways sometimes. This film does get really dark too, towards the end (like most of Anderson's movies), and I love it for it."}, {"score": "2/10", "review": "Daniel Day-Lewis must have thought to himself, \"Why not go out in a blazing streak of fatuous pomposity?!?\" If only the endless, repetitive scenes of characters walking up and down the fancy-dancy staircase had been mercifully edited out, then it might have been closer to 90 minutes of my life I can't get back."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "\"Phantom Thread\" (2017 release; 130 min.) brings the story of Reynolds Woodcock and Alma. As the movie opens, we see Alma talking about Reynolds. We then go back in time, as we get to know Reynolds, a dressmaker for royalty and high society in the 1950s London. Reynolds is stressing out due to the visit of a baroness, and at the urging of his sister, Reynolds decodes to go to his country house, away from London. As luck would have it, when he takes breakfast the next morning, he is waited on by charming Alma, and Reynolds, a lifelong bachelor (marriage would make me deceitful\", he comments at one point), is immediately smitten and asks her out for dinner. Alma accepts. At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest oeuvre (don't just call it a movie!) from writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia; There Will Be Blood, The Master, just to name those). Here he brings a love story, Paul Thomas Anderson-style of course. At first, it seems love at first sight (\"I've been looking for you for a long time\", admits Reynolds), but then clouds appear.... I shan't say more plot-wise. Anderson leaves us guessing from start to finish, and in that sense it is a mystery movie, but of course the movie is so much more than that. There are stretches where seemingly nothing happens (in the best possible way), and we get to enjoy the scenery and of course the performances. Daniel Day-Lewis has said that he is retiring from acting after this movie. Say it ain't so! He is masterful here as the top of a small fashion house for the rich and famous (yes, even a Belgian royal highness is seen as coming from Brussels to buy her wedding dress at the Woodcock house). But even better is Vicky Krieps, the (for me) previously unknown Luxembourg actress who reminds me of Meryl Streep era-Kramer vs. Kramer. As Alma struggles to keep up with Reynolds, yet feels strongly attached to him, she pleads with him \"Whatever you do, do it carefully\". Wow, just wow. With this breakthrough role, we have just seen the very beginning of what I am sure will be a long career in Hollywood. Last but certainly not least, the classical-leaning original score is absolutely fantastic, and is composed by Anderson's house composer over the last decade, Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood. This movie is already gathering quite a few nominations for the upcoming awards season, in particular for Anderson, Day-Lewis, and Greenwood, and deservedly so.\"Phantom Thread\" finally went wide this weekend, and the Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely I am happy to report. If you are a fan of Anderson's previous work or are simply in the mood for an exquisitely made love story that will leave you guessing until the very end, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. \"Phantom Thread\" is a WINNER."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Phantom Thread is exquisitely textured. The director creates individual pieces of emotional fabric that are artistically woven into a movie that can be so palpable that it can almost be tasted. Daniel Day Lewis has some classic lines with sometimes humorous undertones. A real delight. Sorry public- no explosions or car chases."}, {"score": "5/10", "review": "I'm not sure why I expected anything different from Phantom Thread. It's a Paul Thomas Anderson film about a dressmaker in the 1950's. If there's going to be a film that bores me to sleep, it would likely be that film. It's not that Phantom Thread is a bad film. It's beautifully shot, well-acted, and I can certainly acknowledge that the film is well-made overall. But there was no part of this film that I enjoyed. This dark and twisted relationship between Daniel Day-Lewis' Reynolds and Vicky Krieps' Alma is interesting, but I can't ever see myself ever revisiting this one.When I found yourself drifting within 30 minutes of the film beginning, I knew that the film wasn't for me. But let's discuss the good before I bore you even more than I already have. This is apparently Day-Lewis' last film, and with the type of role that Reynolds is, I think it was a nice way to go out. Of course, Lincoln would have been a better way to end, but I guess that's out of the question. Reynolds is creepy, manipulating, obsessive, devoted, and downright obscure. All things I'm sure that a method actor loves tapping into. There may not be anyone better than DDL in history, but I'm not even sure that he deserves to be nominated for an Oscar for his turn as Reynolds. He likely will, but I can definitely find 5 better performances. Even with that said, DDL carries the film and instantly elevates his fellow actors. In all though, Phantom Thread is a film for a select audience, and it's slow building twisted love story is not something I found to be worth over 2 hours of my time.5.7/10"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "\"Phantom Thread\" is mesmerizing and profoundly sad. Daniel Day-Lewis is riveting and powerful as the solitary artist unwilling to release control of his own world to surrender to love. In Writer and Director Paul Thomas Anderson's \"Phantom Thread\" set in post-War 1950's London, Day-Lewis plays renowned dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock, who designs wedding dresses for all of London's elite. Middle-aged Woodcock is the confirmed bachelor taking and discarding his lovers. Reynolds along with devoted sister Cyril, played by powerfully understated Leslie Manville, lead the fashion House of Woodcock. Having also foregone marriage, Cyril apparently cares for her brother, who seemingly battles depression. Woodcock is the paradox. He creates beauty, accommodating women with his fashion. Yet, in his personal relationship with women, he is unforgiving. Daniel is brilliant restraint and the master of detail in Woodcock's focused will constructing his world that he imposes upon those close to him. Day-Lewis's Woodcock has no self-awareness, his character failing. He allows no space for love, much less granting permission to love him; aside from his Cyril. On holiday at their family vacation home, Woodcock encounters beguiling natural beauty Alma, authentically vulnerable Vicky Krieps. Woodcock romances Alma in his distinguishing style. Is he falling in love with his discovered muse or is she merely the ideal model? Woodcock confesses, \"I've been looking for you for a long time.\" While walking on the gorgeous hills of the English coastline Alma says, \"You found me...\" So is this the beginnings of true love?Director Anderson creates the elegant world of fashion and privilege with meticulous images and the moving musical score. His love story of Woodcock and Alma resonates as deeply sad. Someone wise said that profound sadness heals loss. Poignantly, the sadness in \"Phantom Thread\" is the kind that reminds of past loss, and perpetuates. Yet, the possibility of profound sadness may exist in the narrative resolve. Reynolds suffers with the loss of his Mother as a young boy. He loved her so, but never completed his loss. Anyone who dares intimacy with him suffers the consequences. That narrative thread is sown into the very canvas of \"Phantom Thread\". At the tipping point of Woodcock and Alma's love affair, Cyril defends her distinct fondness for Alma. Brave Cyril warns her brother, \"Don't pick a fight with me. You certainly won't come out alive. I'll go right through you...\" Woodcock is his own worst enemy, of which he has no clue. When all three are present, Woodcock tragically says, \"There is an air of quiet death in this house...\" That is so. And Reynolds is the source. In the ironic narrative twist Alma betrays Woodcock to calm their volatile relationship. Strangely, this element enlists defining gravitas. Cyril and Alma truly love Reynolds. Ultimately, he must choose to give up being right about everyone. That is hard for anyone to do. Director Anderson is unflinching and patient in revealing his portrait of humility and personal surrender. His story falters at times, yet his humanity is eloquence. \"Phantom Thread\" is beauty and sadness. Day-Lewis, Manville, and Krieps are all sublime. \"Phantom Thread\" inquires: What you would sew into the canvas of your life or for those you love? \"Phantom Thread\" is wonderful and touching to behold."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "Phantom thread is a pas de trios, a delicate dance for three, in which there's no clear dominant player and the relationships between members of trio are constantly renegotiated. The movie Phantom thread directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (also directed there will be blood) is about Reynolds Woodcock( Daniel day-Lewis tall, lanky, stylish )who likes peace and quiet when alone and when working on his superb gowns for attractive, rich ladies. Reynolds and his sister Cyril (Lesley Manville) understand each other very well and look out for each other all the time. Then comes Alma (Vicky Krieps)into Reynolds life. Alma, a waitress, and Reynolds fall in love instantly. Alma gets tired of Reynolds uppity up mannerisms and talk and lack of freedom in living her life the way she wants. So, Alma decides to make Reynolds slightly ill to make him depend on her so she could have him for herself. Some parts of movie reminded me of the movie boxing Helena by Jennifer lynch and of course Pink's song please don't leave me video . The movie is good. Too long. Daniel Day Lewis is a terrific actor and gave a touch of class to this movie."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "For any cinephile, going to the theater to see the latest Daniel Day-Lewis movie is considered mandatory viewing. The same goes for director Paul Thomas Anderson, who, like Day-Lewis, opts for quality over quantity by selectively releasing a piece of work once every 3 to 5 years. When combined, as they've done with 'Phantom Thread' (and the second such instance following 2007's 'There Will Be Blood'), the necessity in seeing the film is given an order of magnitude greater importance.At best, 'Phantom Thread' stands to receive a polarizing reaction from viewers. It's a fine (I'd say perhaps even exemplary) film within the drilled-down genre of \"English-set period-piece romantic dramas.\" However, when judged from a broader perspective, the film is simply far less captivating than either Day-Lewis' or Anderson's prior work, and the rather esoteric ending leaves audience members wishing the two had dedicated their respective time and effort to another pursuit."}]
