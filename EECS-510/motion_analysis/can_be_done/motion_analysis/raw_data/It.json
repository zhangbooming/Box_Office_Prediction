[{"score": "9/10", "review": "What persuaded me to watch this movie was the blessing bestowed upon it by the stories original creator, Stephen King, who claimed: \"I wasn't prepared for how good it really was\".He's not wrong.\"IT\" is quite extraordinary. The attention to detail, the subtle but effective comedic undertone and the exquisite cinematography not only do the original title proud, they make this re-imagining of the original classic even better than its predecessor. It's a very scary film but what impressed me was how true the film sticks to the original's tricks; it isn't filled with loud in-your-face jump scares, in fact, a lot of what makes this film scary is the slick cinematography and intricate shadow play. The use of lighting and creation of atmosphere is what makes this film so tense, which is why it's perfectly suited for those who like Horror movies but without the obnoxious gore.Watched the pre-release as a critic - August 28th."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "I had the pleasure of seeing an advanced screening of IT in Brisbane. The film is absolutely brilliant. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd has taken Pennywise and made the role his own. Creepy, disturbing, humorous, IT really possess the creep factor, giving audiences a new reason to fear clowns. The entire casting choices were sensational. All actors really held their own, creating a sense of comradery between the characters. Like most people, I do hold the miniseries with Tim Curry close to my heart, but after seeing this adaptation, I was beyond pleasantly surprised. So much so that upon IT being released into cinemas, I'll be back in line to see it again."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "I managed to win a preview screening to 'IT' on the 30th of August, in Sydney. I had high expectations for this film - and IT exceeded them. The acting. Great performances all round. The kids had great chemistry, and you really believe that they were all great friends. It reminded me of Stand By Me and The Goonies. Out of the child actors, Richie (played by Finn Wolfhard) was my favourite and his jokes cracked the whole cinema up. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Pennywise is scary and really creeped me out, but for me there was just something missing about his character and I think he wasn't given enough dialogue.A minor flaw for me was that the plot was a bit rushed, in terms with the development of Mike (played by Chosen Jacobs), but for an adaption from a book, they managed to condense the original material very well.Overall, it (no pun intended) was a great thriller film that kept me on the edge of my seat, with strong performances."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "The performance of Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd is good along with the kids performance, like Bev, Mike etc. It was super faithful to the novel, more than the 1990 miniseries and they added new scenes.

All child actors are well cast, with their strengths and weaknesses perfectly at display. Their interaction and friendship is handled with ease and good humour and is by far the most enjoyable part of the story.Less tasteful is how they interact with adults who are distant and authoritative or just as much monsters as the one that is after the kids. The recent Stranger Things, one cast member of which reappears, had this covered much better, with the obvious note that Stranger Things itself is an evolution of King's and Spielberg's earlier works. The school bullies are also ridiculously evil and inhuman which is seldom seen in today's media.As King's popular novel is much copied, the terrifying events, however carefully produced, come across somewhat outdated. The number of jump scares feels like yet another throwback to old-school horror. Music swells to underline everything that happens on the screen, with no emotion without a score to tell the audience exactly what they should be experiencing right now. That gets intrusive quickly.What the marketing entirely skips, this is actually the part 1. It covers the first half of the novel only, with the rest coming in the part 2."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "The brand new #ITMovie scared the heck out of me and I don't throw that around loosely because just when you thought that \"Annabelle: Creation\" may have set the bar for this year, bam! \"IT\" comes along and smashes that bar into pieces. Wow! This is one incredible horror film, everybody involved should get a congratulatory pat on the back, definitely a huge upgrade from the '90s miniseries. This is best Stephen king adaptation yet.Directed by Andy Muschietti, based on Stephen King's timeless novel of the same name, IT is set around the mysterious disappearance of children in Derry Maine, when a group of young kids will have to come face their biggest fears and square off against an eternal evil clown named Pennywise who comes around every 27 years to repeat his reign of terror. It's no secret and it's not really a spoiler that New Line and the filmmakers of this new version have planned to re-imagine this story into two installments, with the first focusing on the children and then chapter two will be about their grown up selves once again battling Pennywise. So with this first chapter, I think the timing of its arrival couldn't be more perfect especially with last year's debut of the hugely popular series, \"Stranger Things\" that brings up '80s childhood nostalgia while presenting mystery at the same time, \"IT\" offers you that same vein and I think that's OK because we haven't gotten to the point where it's played out so for the time being you're going to love that aspect about \"IT.\" There's definitely a \"Stand By Me\" vibe to it as well, and the whole thing does feel episodic, at one point while screening it I didn't want it to end, it felt like I was binge-watching, it was so cool. Kudos to all the young actors featured in this film, they really hold their own and each of their characters' distinct personalities stand out. Their backstories and their process of slowly but surely coming together as some sort of a team is both honest and engaging. Now, if you've ever read Stephen King's book, \"IT,\" you'd recall that it is a super duper thick book. You can use it as a stool to stand on for when you need to change that lightbulb. But the point is, I think the screenwriters of this new film did well in condensing the story to just the right amount of time that contains just the right mix of kids camaraderie and the horror fest that is Pennywise. And if you've watched the '90s miniseries, you'd recall how much that version held back plus the low quality practical effects that they had at the time. Well, I'm happy to tell you that this new \"IT\" doesn't hold back, this is Pennywise unleashed, it's practically proud of being R-rated, which is great because it allows for the scary parts to be really really scary and not second-guessing or pandering. And if you have never liked clowns before, you're going to hate clowns even more because Bill Skarsgard's performance as the new Pennywise will haunt your dreams for the next few weeks after you've watched this movie. What I appreciate about Skarsgard is that he doesn't try too hard to emulate or imitate or channel Tim Curry, Skarsgard does his own take of creepy. And because Pennywise is pretty much invincible to a certain extent, you'll see him pop up in the most unlikeliest of places meaning when you least expect him, that's when he'll scare you to your core so brace yourselves for surprises around every corner. Another reason why the timing of this movie's arrival could not be more perfect is because today's visual effects compliment Pennywise's limitless abilities and so director Andy Muschietti and his crew have the creative freedom to not only realize some of the scare points in the book but they managed to also go beyond that. \"IT\" goes for massive, it goes for bold, it goes for bloody, not a single boring minute, it goes for the \"Goonies\" fan in all of us. You will laugh, you will scream, you will have nightmares, hands down one of the best horror movies ever made. -- Rama's Screen --"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "a great add-on to the IT world. more \"book accurate\" than the TV mini series. a great experience. much more violent.

There were several bits of comic relief scattered in, even in the middle of really tense parts of the movie, so that your adrenaline wasn't engaged the ENTIRE time.

But just as you forget, something happens and scares the life out of you. Bill was just creepy enough. The voice, the laugh and the fact he made it seem as if Pennywise was constantly having so much fun playing with his meal. 10/10 would recommend. It's more than a horror movie, it's a brilliantly told story."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "I went into 'It' with the potential to absolutely love it, or absolutely hate it. The horror genre has been on life-support in my opinion for a long time. So even the mention of expected quality behind a horror film is greeted with skepticism. However the trailers looked promising and an 'R' rating was incredibly pleasing to see. So what was the actual result? Certainly more positives than negatives.The film starts with a scene which sets the tone for the entire film. I had actually seen the majority of this scene in a \"Presented by Stephen King\" prior to another film I had seen in the cinema. The scene cut off before the end though and I have been wondering ever since exactly how it was going to play out. I finally got to find out this morning and I was very pleased. This scene works perfectly to infuse the audience with the notion that 'It' is indeed a genuine threat to each and every character.The things I liked most about the film: * The look of 'Pennywise' - he was genuinely intimidating, mysterious and captivating to watch.* The set designs - rarely do I notice things like this on the first viewing of a film, however on this occasion it was impossible not to. They were impressive.* The cast of children - in particular Finn Wolfhard showed class beyond his years in being the funny guy of the film.* The pacing - while this has a very long run time for a horror movie, it never really feels like it. To say it is non-stop action is probably going a step too far, but it's not far off it. 'Pennywise' was in the film a lot more than I expected which helped with this.The things I didn't like as much: * At times it feels like it is trying a little too hard - for the most part there is a level of subtlety in most scenes, however just on occasion they get a little too in your face with the scare they are trying to give you.* Also (and I'm sure there was a reason for this) I didn't like the fact that there wasn't a single likable adult in the film. In fact every single adult in the film is outwardly unlikable. This wouldn't have been done by mistake, but it is still a very depressing and unrealistic aspect of the film.Altogether though 'It' is a very good horror film. There's definitely the usual substance of a Stephen King film, while still managing to fit in more than enough scares and suspense to keep any type of audience members happy. If you're as disillusioned by the horror genre as I am then make sure you see 'It'. It might just give you an air of hope like it has done for me."}, {"score": "2/10", "review": "Apart from the crew which is really cute and the most of the time acting decently, film was one of the worst this year.

Go watch it."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "IT is a horror drama film based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. Starring Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd in the title role, the film not only succeeds as a terrifying horror film but also as one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work to date.In 1989 in the town of Derry, Maine, a group of outcast kids known as the \"Losers Club\", are each terrorised by a frightening, shape-shifting entity they collectively refer to as \"IT\". When no one else in town will come to their aide, the kids decide to band together and fight against \"IT\" themselves while also overcoming their own personal demons.Like with comedy, horror is a highly subjective genre. What one may find scary may cause others to roll their eyes in annoyance. Thankfully, IT provides enough scares that seem as realistic as possible and prevent the film from being silly. This retelling takes itself very seriously and doesn't constantly rely on jump scares for legitimate horror, instead by building a creepy atmosphere of uncertainty and individual torment in each of the kids. The cast is fantastic, Bill Skarsgard's performance as IT, in particular that of his clown form Pennywise, is terrifying, almost on par with Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. He definitely feels like more of a threat than Tim Curry's version, whom by today's standards seems a little too goofy and wacky to be scary. In addition to Pennywise, all of the child actors are brilliant. Not once did I ever feel unconvinced of the fear that they were feeling. Even the usual Stephen King tropes seemed more subdued in this film, aside from the usual setting in Maine, of course. If this is the future for adaptations of Stephen King's work, then I am most certainly on board.I rate it 8.5/10"}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "First of all it was a successful trip to the movies on my part. At no point did I shush the speculative whispering behind me or throw my box of popcorn over the squad to me left (apparently they got a lot of the film's humour I kept missing As teenager of the 80's I loved Stephen King although IT was never a particular fave. The book felt like Stand By Me with a killer clown and got very dodgy near the end. I've tried twice to make it through the mini-series, both when it came out and recently to no avail. I think the problem is clowns don't scare me. That aside I love a good horror film and the trailer for IT 2017 sold me. Don't watch the trailer though, just get along and see IT.If you enjoyed the book, you'll love IT. If you haven't viewed the trailer, you'll love IT even more as the movie's most effective sequence is somewhat spoiled by the trailer, shame too as it's truly a frighting thrill ride moment of the film that like a roller coaster, leaves you out of breath and clapping at the end.My only gripe with the film is it lacks patience and strives to key up feelings of terror too soon by way of every sound/trailer trope in the book: WHHHoooosh...booom. screeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEECH *sudden silence* BBBBBOOOOOMMM THUMP... They even used the 'ringing ears/everything sounds muffled for 10 seconds' bit usually reserved for war movies. Meanwhile on screen, nothing is really happening yet but oh boy, the soundtrack is almost unrelenting. I felt like screaming \"Okay, I get it!

Something evil lurks in the town and it's up to the Loser's Club to overcome their fear and unite to confront IT ...I found the old TV movie somewhat dull in the second half. The first half, which this movie is concerned with, was always the stronger half and I think this version is probably just as good, if not better than the original TV movie. It's certainly more gruesome and scary.I'm not sure Tim Curry's Pennywise has been upstaged though. Bill Skarsgard has done a good job but I think Curry's is hard to beat.IT 2017 is refreshingly old-school, in that it focuses on character and story, unlike too many recent \"horror\" movies.

The movie wastes no time in getting started within the first 5 mins we have the famous drain scene where Georgie talks to Pennywise. This one is so much more memorable and will never be forgotten anytime soon. What made this movie way better than the original is that the kid actors were really good, and their development and chemistry is really strong!

One of the best stand out performers was Finn Wolfhard (who plays Richie)...he was really funny and provided so much laughs. Sophia Lillis (who plays Beverly) was also another strong performer.

He did an amazing job and he was really scary. The only problem is that he wasn't givin' enough lines. When Pennywise speaks Bill does an amazing job at making each line so creepy. I hope he gets more lines in the second one. I guess the reason for this is because they wanted to keep him more scary and less funny (like Tim Curry's version).All in all...it's the best Stephen King Horror Movie to ever have hit the theaters.

Furthermore (pretending as if 'Stranger Things' never existed), it owes much to King's other novel/movie adaptation 'Stand by Me' in the 'young kids in the 80's find meaning and maturity in their adventure days' plot line. But lets be clear; even comparing those two greats to this film, should make clear, what class of filmmaking is on display here. The strongest element of the movie is by far the cast, and they are, by all accounts, rock solid. Truly, you want them too live. Gifted child actors seem to be coming out the wood works these days and how great it is; allowing cinema to opt for a fresh, more unique perspective on old material. You could call them all idiots for the things they do, but truly, they are kids. They are daring, stupid, timid people.

There were also a few brilliantly subtle music cues, amongst a lot of crescendosI want to see horror films return to having a physical villain ( as last year's Green Room, and Don't Breathe, as well as this film has ) rather than yet another ghost story/ supernatural/ haunting flick, like we've had seemingly never ending examples of in the past several years. Granted, this film has supernatural elements in it, but it simultaneously has an actual villain, a physical entity threatening the protagonists, which is where I hope horror films return to. Its 135-minutes long run time basically flew by quickly.The opening credits call the film, It, while the closing credits call the film, It Chapter One. The Cult, my all time favourite band, are on the soundtrack, also. Fifteen minutes in, we hear about thirty seconds of Love Removal Machine"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Phew this movie was absolutely amazing! It was having quite a lot of scary images and shocking disturbing scenes. What I love most about this movie was the great sound effects. They were really exceptional and I think a lot of us in the audience (especially my wife and including myself) were given the scare due to the sound effects. If you have seen the trailer and you already thought it was amazing, well you ain't seen nothing yet, coz the movie was way better. This was not a movie where all the good things have been shown in the trailer and there were no more surprises. I also loved the way the movie's tone was constantly interesting. Whenever the scene was not creepy or scary, the behavior of the kids were always fun to see. It had an aura of \"coming to age\" in this movie with so many natural things that boys their age would do/face (you will get loads of laughs during the swimming part, or Ben's crush on Beverly and many more). They would definitely grow on you. The characterization of the clown by Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd was spot on and he was indeed quite scary. The kids gave wonderful performances as well. We could actually picture them as kids in real life.Another good part was the setting (like the bikes, the houses, the costumes) that really gave the feel of 1980s. Including the popular boy band then, i.e. New Kids on the Block and the iconic walkman. As a horror movie, I think this one successfully gave us a scare, but apart from those scary moments, I think the best part was the ability of the director (Andr\u00e9s Muschietti who directed another horror movie Mama in 2013) to direct a bunch of young actors and actress and create a great movie. I think this one was worthy of all the buzz and I can understand why it was loved by those movie critics. Overall, this movie was awesome entirely. I had a most interesting experience watching this movie in the theater with my wife. Not even the loud voices of people next to me could disturb my enjoyment. So please for those of you horror lovers, you should watch this one at the theaters near you asap. It is definitely worth to see either with your loved ones or with your friends, but this one not suitable for kids, even if the majority of the casts are children. I think those who loved the novel IT written by Stephen King would enjoy this one as well. I understand it was a very good adaptation of the novel, much better than The Dark Tower. And better not miss this one out coz the ending of the movie gave the hint of a possible sequel (fingers crossed). Oh ya, there was no post end credit scene that you probably expect from this kind of movie, though there was some interesting thing just before the end in case you want to wait for it.for my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"}]
