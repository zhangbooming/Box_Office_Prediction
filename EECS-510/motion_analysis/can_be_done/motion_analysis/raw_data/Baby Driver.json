[{"score": "5/10", "review": "Edgar Wright is known to deliver, if nothing at all, very entertaining films. Baby Driver is no exception. With an all star cast including Ansol Elgort, Jamie Foxx, Lilly James, Jon Hamm and Kevin Spacey, Baby Driver not only is an extremely well cast and choreographed film, it just might be the best film of Edgar Wright's career. Telling the story of a young man named Baby, who is a professional getaway driver who needs music in order to complete his jobs, as he navigates through the criminal underworld. When he takes a risky job for a mysterious gangster (played by Kevin Spacey), he finds himself on the run after things go horribly wrong. With his girl by his side and his music in his hands, Baby must use his specific skillset to get out of the underworld.Before anyone says it, yes, this film plays like a less serious Drive. The storyline is not what is supposed to stand out here, the incredible direction under Edgar Wright and the great central performance from Ansol Elgort are definitely the stand outs here. Granted, I doubt that Elgort would have been able to deliver such a great performance without the amazing supporting cast that Wright wrangles up, but he ends up giving a great performance here as Baby. The rest of the cast is more or less there for name recognition only as none of them go above and beyond in their performance. Despite this, the cast are mere pawns in Edgar Wright's brilliant film. The real stars of Baby Driver are the stunt teams. These car chases are finally something new. With the incredible automobile warfare that the Fast and Furious franchise has given us for decades, it was nice to see a film embrace a smaller scale of car chase. It is real, exhilarating and downright perfect for this film. Truthfully, the car chase sequences here are some of the best that I've seen since Refn's Drive but that's just me. Speaking of Drive, how could I forget Wright's amazing choice of soundtrack. The soundtrack is about just as great as the stunt team's work on this film. This is very much in the vein of Scott Pilgrim as far as soundtrack is concerned and is bound to be a hit come time for the film to premiere in its wide release.Overall, Edgar Wright delivers an action movie with a flawed perfection to it. The story is paper thin, the acting is passable (except for Ansol Elgort, who is terrific), but the action sequences and soundtrack are amazing. These two components are more than enough reasons to go see this film."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "This is actually my first review on here. I had the chance to see this movie as an advanced screening at my university. I now feel obligated to let fellow movie afficionados know that this movie is simply freaking awesome. I love good music and cars (especially Subarus like the one from the trailer) and that alone was a good enough reason for me to go watch this movie. I was not disappointed. I find Edgar Wright's movies entertaining. However, this movie was a step above that. Take La La Land, combine it with heist & Fast & Furious elements to it and you have Baby Driver. The casting was great. Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey have similar roles to the ones in Horrible Bosses, but that does not make it any less fun. The cinematography is exceptional and the plot is intriguing and unpredictable. The camera work in one of the opening scenes reminded me of Birdman, which is a Best Picture Academy Award winner, so this movie is definitely executed in a stylish manner, and has a great attention to detail. The soundtrack is picked to perfection and the dialogue is the wittiest, funniest one I have seen in a movie in a long time. I only see two cons for the movie. One: some of the action sequences did seem a little unbelievable, so if you want a completely realistic movie, you might want to trade some of that for the entertaining factor. Two: it was an advanced screening and the movie only comes out in 2 months... and I already want to watch it again. I rarely rate movies 10/10 but it was the most fun I've had in a theater and that certainly deserves my rating."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Edgar Wright's newest film captures everything you can possibly love about going to the movies. It's filled with wonderful characters, great car chases, enough style for a dozen cool flicks, and yes, a soundtrack that is better than sex. While using a familiar story template (the Driver & Drive), Wright completely makes it his own, infusing it with his love for music and his film geekiness. Wright has a perfect filmography at this point and definitely deserves to be ranked as one of the finest directors of the past 20 years. This may be his best movie yet.The cast is note perfect, the only downside is that Jon Bernthal's role is almost more of a cameo (considering the top billing). Ansel Elgort is wonderful as Baby, bringing an instant likability and purity to the character. The supporting cast is equally great with Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, and Eiza Gonzalez as the standouts. The scenes between all three of them contain the most electricity and tension.The car chases are brilliantly shot, eschewing the dull over-the-top silliness of the Fast & Furious franchise for something much more grounded and much more exciting. The lack of special effects keeps up the tension with actual stunt driving, continuing the good trend of recent actions films going back to doing things for real, showing an understanding of the genre.Usually, I try to not let myself get too hyped about a new film coming out, but this is the exception. I can't remember the last time I had this much pure fun at the movies and all of you need to see it. I was lucky enough to get into an advanced screening and I almost regret it: waiting two months before I can see it again is unbearable torture."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "It's Fast Cars, with less fast cars and more plot; the movie cares more about the soundtrack than it does the cars on screen and more about the plot than it does stringing together driving sequences. The film is an absolute trip from start to finish, with all the action and sometimes over-the-top violence you might expect, toned down considerably by the character-driven plot. Elgort is a truly delightful male lead who \u2014with a touch of charm, innocence\u2014 brought the humor needed to temper the less-than-savory company he keeps.The supporting cast is also no disappointment. Jon Hamm (Buddy) found the perfect follow up film to Mad Men playing an angry criminal, head-over- heels in love with his wife, Darling (Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez). Jamie Foxx embodies bat-sh** crazy as Bats and Spacey plays a very familiar type of criminal mastermind (he's basically a chubbier version of Frank Underwood). Jon Bernthal (Griff) is more of a cameo than an actual cast supporting cast member, which is surprising and a bit disappointing.Silly name aside, if you like any of the cast members, heist movies, good music, fast cars, quick plot turns or Edgar Wright's brand of action this is certainly a film worth seeing.Featuring: Brogan Hall as Samm, reminding us all that it is, in fact, the #YearOfTheChildActor and notable allusions to some of the greatest films of all time: Monsters Inc. and Little Rascals."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "The film stars Ansel Elgort as the titular character in deep with some undesirables from the criminal underworld. To pay them back, he must use his driving skills to help with a number of heists. During all this, he becomes smitten with a waitress (Lily James) who makes him feel like he's more than just a criminal. He then decides to try and escape his life of crime, but he soon realizes that it's much easier said than done.I must say, Edgar Wright did a fantastic job with this film. All the music fit so well in their respective scenes, combined with the great acting all around to make one of the most entertaining films I've seen in a long time.Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez did their parts well and portrayed convincing mentally unstable killers. This is the first time Wright has worked with this much star power, specifically American star power. The actors played well off of each other, especially in scenes involving comedy where they nailed the punchlines.The music was good, not all of it recognizable by the average viewer, but effective nonetheless. Supposedly Edgar Wright based the whole movie idea around the Baby Driver song by Simon & Garfunkel, which is an accomplishment all on it's own. Baby Driver was paced well, was never boring, and made me want sit back down in my seat and watch it over again. I wanted to keep this review kind of short, but I did want to give you enough information to hopefully convince you to go out and see this film if you get the chance.My suggestion: Do yourself a favor, go enjoy a night out at the movies and go see Baby Driver!Seen at a advance screening in Roseville, Minnesota."}, {"score": "4/10", "review": "Saw it and, aside from a fun pre-title chase scene, this movie is wildly overpraised. Ansel Elgort is not the next big thing and the story, which revolves around three heists, is a real nothing burger. Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx are both fine acting like bad ass tough guys, but their characters aren't original enough or interesting enough and the dialogue isn't consistently clever/cool enough to sustain the movie (there's only a handful of funny lines; Kevin Spacey gets the best one). The Usual Suspects, The Town, and Heat did it all MUCH better. The romance between Elgort and Lily James aims for sweet and mostly misses, but she's awfully cute and manages to make her time on screen pleasant. If you're expecting a lot of great car chase scenes you will definitely be disappointed. There's really only a couple and, as I said, only the first is impressive. Honestly, while watching it I was wondering what all the fuss was about. This is yet another example of people being swayed by movie critic peer pressure to praise a movie just so they can be part of the in-crowd, a member of the cool club. The truth is: the movie ain't all that."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "breathtaking one, this one..... amazing story,perfect casting,stunning actors,everything fits in its right place....great camera works, ..funny,exiting,fast,romantic,....beautiful soundtrack... saw this masterpiece in it's performance for badge holders only..when it will be officially released within a couple of weeks here in Holland....i'll be there again, for sure. seen at Vue theater, Hoorn, Holland a must go movie!!"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Now I have to admit that i haven't seen a lot of Edgar Wright movies, I've heard a lot of people praise him for Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim, Shaun of the Dead, The World's End. I've only seen Hot Fuzz and wasn't a big fan, but the trailers for Baby Driver were really good and I just went in with an open mind.This movie is only as good as the lead character called Baby. I haven't seen Ansel Elgort in any movies but he gave a great performance as Baby and the character was great and relatable.He's a getaway driver for heists and always listens to music because of an accident that happened when he was young. The reason for him to listen to music is explained and a great reason and I love that he listens to a classic IPod. I had an IPod like that so that made it relatable and just Baby is a great character, so that really made the movie for me.Other than Baby, the rest of the movie is also great, I absolutely loved it, there really are no issues I have with it.So besides the main character, what else makes the movie great? Well, the side characters are really good as well. Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Lily James and so on, they're all really great. I totally believed the love story between Baby and the girl Debora. I honestly was afraid of that but they made it work perfectly.Another thing I loved was the soundtrack, throughout almost the entirety of the movie the score and the soundtrack is used and it works perfectly. They made it another character in the movie.Of course this is also an action movie, so the question is how the action is shot. Well, if you saw the trailers you could see some really cool shots there, the movie is no different. The style is great and luckily most of the action is shot with long takes and all in frame. I was so into the action because it was so well shot and it was practical. I have to admit that I don't know if they used CGI but that's the great thing, if there was CGI, I didn't see that it was CGI, so that's great.They also make the action line up with the music, and not in a way that it's stupid and doesn't work but in a very clever way that it only makes the movie better.So essentially everything this movie needed to do for me, it delivered, great action, great characters, great soundtrack. It's an extremely fun movie, I had a blast with it, it's my favourite movie of the year so far and I hope that there are movies to top it because that means this year will be awesome. Baby Driver is a 10/10."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "I had put this movie on my watch list as the trailer intrigued me but I had no real expectations going into it. All I thought was this would be a heist/car chase movie, that it would be popcorn entertainment with a promising cast lineup. I'm not sure if it was my lowered expectations or my being surprised, but this movie blew me away. From the very first scene, this is such an enticing movie. It has an oddness to it that is so charming and fun, with a main character that makes you love this quirks. On top of that, it is well shot, directed and acted. With a general plot that is not all too original but it's the characters and the style of the movie that take it far away from something ordinary.I would suggest seeing this movie if you are a music lover or love action movies with something more than the mundane. A car movie with soul. Excited to see it again."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "I was hugely excited for this, as a fan of Wright ever since Spaced. But I left feeling really underwhelmed. If you want a Kingsman style lightly amusing comedy with a good soundtrack then its great. But if you're looking for the warm, cosy, nuanced and observed humour and subtle wit of the Cornetto trilogy with a bunch of heart and charm then you might feel underwhelmed too. Whats wrong with it? (spoiler free) It over-relies on the central idea of music and syncing. If that had been one element on the side of a much more interesting and character driven heist film (e.g. just a gimmick of the driver), it could have worked brilliantly. But because its been SO built around that idea, you start thinking \"really, is the idea even that interesting?\" The syncing becomes more distracting with its fantasy elements (e.g. Hamm shooting a gun in time to the music that Baby's listening to). Its fine for a short film or music video, but it gets stretched a little thin across a whole feature (especially when there's precious little between these moments to be interested in). There are precious few actual car chases. I was expecting a climactic crazy chase on a scale with the one in Blues Brothers, something over the top and cinematic as with Hot Fuzz, but it never happens. The action shifts instead to some pedestrian action in a car park interior. The chases themselves are fairly short and really not very inventive - beside the music syncing there's just nothing interesting about them. The opening of Drive feels far more engaging and interesting in comparison. The central romance falls flat. The girl just comes across as fake and irritating, with zero chemistry between them. Because of this, Baby's purpose to be with her has no credibility. The other characters are all weak. I craved some of the brilliantly nuanced characters of Wrights other work, even ones that pop up for brief moments (e.g. Peggs housemate or Reese Shearsmith's character in Shaun). Spacey does a hugely watered down version of his Glengary character. Jon Bernthal's more interesting character only pops up for a brief pointless cameo to make 'retard' jokes, never to be seen again. The cinematography feels dull like a TV pilot, its just not inventive in the way that it feels like it should be. Visually, its the weakest Wright film by far. The plot is clich\u00e9d. For a heist film, there is nothing inventive or memorable about the writing or story whatsoever.The music is obviously great, and there are some nice amusing moments. But it didn't live up to the film I imagined from the hype, or Edgar's other movies, at all. I feel like people are just being suggestible to the idea of \"cool music\" and marketing."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "I saw this as an Odeon Screen Unseen viewing. I didn't know what the film was likely to be as i purposely wanted to be surprised. The best thing i can say about this movie is that it was the third best movie i saw in the past week. it was up against stiff competition. I had seen both Baywatch and Wonder Woman the week before. The casting of Baby was masterful and Jamie Fox and Kevin Spacey were both wonderful. But i have to say my favourite character was definitely Baby the dynamic between him and his foster father as well as with doc is amazing. The romance in it was good it wasn't overplayed or forced. In all The film was good and was a decent way to spend a couple of hours but i wouldn't pay full price to see it in the cinema."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Those are two great songs from the 1970s, used here in the movie. American film, which, as usual in recent years, abounds in retro American music hits. This time, I appreciated the musical taste of the one who chose the songs, because they are European, both Dutch productions, Radar Love by Golden Earring, and Hocus Pocus by Focus, two of the greatest rock groups ever. About the film: it's a good entertaining action movie, containing also a special kind of love story. Ansel Elgort is OK. Jon Hamm is very efficient. Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez is efficient too and beautiful. Kevin Spacey, charming as usual but much fatter than usual. Jamie Foxx is better and better, great personality, in my humble opinion, greater than Denzel Washington and Sidney Poitier and other black actors. Last but not least, I think I'm in love! With Lily James. She's so sweet! And good Actress! So fresh, beautiful eyes, what a smile! I hardly wait to see her in big big roles, in great great movies... All the best to Edgar Wright!"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "'BABY DRIVER' was directed by our lord and saviour Edgar Wright, and stars Ansel Elgort, Lily James and Kevin Spacey. Thanks to a mistake he made when he was younger, Baby(Ansel Elgort) must repay his debt to a heist organiser, Doc(Kevin Spacey). All is going well but when his skills become invaluable to Doc, he must protect his loved ones and try to escape while he still can.Wow. Where do I start with this movie. I'm not rating it a 10/10 just for the sake of it, it is one of the best movies I've seen all year around. The acting is phenomenal, the stuntwork is up there with the best, the action is great, the plot is great; I have no major flaws with this movie. It's awesome!!!!The story for this movie is fast paced, bright, interesting and most importantly, unpredictable. You may be able to predict certain plot point but I guarantee you won't be able to tell me exactly what will happen. The ending is great. The love story between Baby and Deborah is believable. Edgar Wright you beautiful, beautiful man, you have wrote an fantastic screenplay. Thank you, sir!Ansel Elgort was spectacular in this movie and really impressed me as Baby. He was funny, he was smart, he was cool, he was likable; he's a spectacular character that I guarantee will be copied in future films to come. Lily James was great as Deborah and I really bought their relationship. This was a major complain for many critics but I don't see why. It was engaging, it was believable, and, while Deborah made some incredibly dumb decisions, it was fantastical. Jamie Foxx was brilliant as the sly and distrustful Bats. Kevin Spacey command the scenes he's in as Doc and is the best non-actor working today. Jon Hamm was excellent as Buddy. Nothing acting or character wise was flawed in this movie but I guess that is to be expected from Wright's pristine track record.Wright directed the hell out of this movie. Every shot is masterfully crafted. Every edit is specifically chosen and targeted. The colour pallet is bright and bold and artistically captivating. This movie is hilarious. All the characters have funny lines and Wright is a genius at comedy. The chase sequences in this movie are probably some of the best ever put to film. And no, I am not overselling them. The thought that what I saw was practical(which it was) makes my brain hurt. The action was awesome. The score is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. I adore this movie, and I will bet that you will to. I' rating this movie a nigh flawless 10 Home InvASIANs out of 10. Please watch this movie! I want it to do really well."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Edgar Wright may not have made too many films however, he's one of the few directors working today that can generate such a buzz for his projects, thanks to their originality and sheer entertainment value. His sixth film, Baby Driver, has been no stranger to positive word of mouth and it is well and truly deserved. Believe the hype because Baby Driver is a pure slice of fried cinematic gold.After being coerced into working for a crime boss, young getaway driver Baby (Ansel Elgort) finds himself taking part in a heist doomed to fail, finding love along the way.Wasting no time in dropping the audience right into the frenetic action, Edgar Wright's Baby Driver is relentlessly paced throughout, building in kinetic energy as each chase sequence rises in intensity and magnitude, leaving you well and truly on the edge of your seat. Featuring incredible stunt work and some swift cinematography from Bill Pope, Baby Driver possesses some of the best chase sequences I've ever seen on film.Another aspect of the film that elevates it to another level is the soundtrack Wright expertly utilises for not only the major chase sequences, but the smaller scale scenes too. Every song works so well, whether it be Tequila accompanying a shootout or Hocus Pocus playing over the film's major chase sequence. Seriously though, the chase sequence that sees Baby trying to escape via both car and foot is just insanely well put together, Hocus Pocus being the real cherry on top.Coming to the performances, Baby Driver features a small yet impressive cast, ranging from relative newcomer Ansel Elgort through to the seasoned pro that is Kevin Spacey. Elgort may not be as charismatic as you'd think however, he really does suit the role of Baby incredibly well because it isn't a role that requires the most charismatic of actors. There are other roles in the film for that, one of them being Jamie Foxx as Bats, a member of the heist team who has a penchant for violence and running his mouth. This is the best I've seen Foxx for a while and, along with the rest of the cast, he looks like he's having a ball.Edgar Wright's Baby Driver has an old school crime caper feel to it but with Wright's sharp writing and knack for humour plus the amazing chase sequences at hand, it really does become something else entirely. This is sure to be one of the most original and thrilling films you could see all year."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "I've felt starved of originality so far this year and this film promised to be a little different. Different it most certainly is.I caught a late night showing of the film some 7 days before it's official release and I drove home quicker than I ever should have, (especially with the dodgy tyre that's hanging off the back of my car), I was in such a rush to throw these words together because the film is just simply THAT BLOODY GOOD! Edgar Wright hasn't just created a film, he's created a piece of art. This is picture and sound working absolutely perfectly with each other, a master class of editing. Gun shots and window wipers sync perfectly with the beats of the music, the volume of the soundtrack dictated by how the main character 'Baby' is experiencing it at the time. In fact, there's only a couple of times throughout the whole feature where the music actually stops, (when the headphones are ripped from his ears) timed so brilliantly with the serious moments of the film. It's a unique and creative effect, the likes I've never seen done before.Ansel Elgort plays the young get away driver 'Baby' and does a fine job of portraying a cool, if somewhat purposely awkward character. Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm & Lily James all perform brilliantly and there's a number of scenes that feature them on screen all together which are genuinely electric. I'm a big fan of Jon Bernthal, especially since his Punisher role in Marvel's DAREDEVIL however I was disappointed to find his role is more of a cameo than anything else. The romance between Baby and Debora (played by Lily James) works well and the chemistry between them shines.The lack of CGI was a breath of fresh air in a world where every film seems to be rammed with it no matter how effective. Prior to the screening, Edgar Wright had recorded a short message for us and he made it very clear that he shot this film using almost entirely practical effects and it shows. Not one bit of poor CGI to ruin the magic, just balls out, car chasing porn.As touched on earlier, the soundtrack is immense. A perfect blend of some well known tracks and some less recognizable, all very effective and match the on screen action beautifully.A couple of small gripes that pop up and ruin an almost perfect get away can be found in the closing chapters. A particular scene in a car park features a few too many cuts for my liking and for a time I struggled to see what was actually happening on screen. The pacing also drops off rather quickly in the final scenes. A more sudden climax would have perhaps worked better to what had been a racey/fast paced film up to that point. It dampened my enthusiasm for the film a touch, which is a shame because the motor was running beautifully until then.Baby Driver doesn't waste any time in pulling you into its world and the camera work in one of the opening scenes is outstanding: A long shot timed perfectly with the music and crammed with brilliantly timed on screen moments, it was superb. The cinematography is exceptional and the plot is intriguing and unpredictable. The amount of attention to detail found in here is something to behold and it's clear Edgar Wright put his absolute all into creating this masterpiece. Finally, the dialogue is some of the wittiest I have heard in a film in a long time, it had the whole cinema laughing out loud numerous times and features some great real world references that are bound to make you smirk.The best way to describe Baby Driver is that it's La La Land being overrun by speeding cars and bank robbers. Throw in some Kingsman style humour and, at times, pretty graphic violence and you've got yourself one hell of a good heist movie! Go see this Baby!

And well before that, as a kid, my poor departed mother used to be driven crazy by me begging her to take me to see \"The Italian Job\" (the original 1969 version) YET again\u0085 probably the greatest getaway chase in movie history: I must have seen that film at least 20 times in the cinema. Of course more recently we've also had Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan in \"Drive\" on the same theme.\u00a0But with Edgar Wright at the helm, a big name cast and an enticing trailer, I had high expectations for \"Baby Driver\" \u2013 and boy was I happy! This is such a seriously cool film on so many levels.Opening with a bank heist followed by a kick-ass car chase, we follow 'Baby' (Ansel Elgort, \"Allegiant\", \"The Fault in our Stars\") as a tinnitus-suffering, music-infused getaway driver under the thumb of the criminal overlord Doc (Kevin Spacey, in icy Frank Underwood mode). Doc recruits an ever-changing mix-tape of villains for each job, including the psychopathic and appropriately named 'Bats' (Jamie Foxx, \"Sleepless\"), the chillingly dangerous Buddy (Jon Hamm, \"Mad Men\", \"Keeping Up With The Joneses\") and his \"Bonnie-style\" wife 'Darling' (Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez) and the moderately incompetent JD (Lanny Joon) (who changed his neck tattoo of \"HATE\" to \"HAT\" since it improved his job prospects\u0085. \"everybody loves a hat\"!).Baby's life gets more complicated when the hoods become aware of his fledgling relationship with fellow-orphan Debora (Lily James) a waitress in a diner and another lever to keep Baby locked into the job that he is just so, so good at.On the surface this might be perceived as being just another good excuse for a lot of CGI-driven car stunts in the style of \"The Fate of the Furious\". But no. Firstly, as Edgar Wright declared before the special screening I saw, all of the car stunts were actually performed for real on the mean streets of Atlanta (and hats off to the film's stunt coordinator Robert Nagle and his team for these).\u00a0 And secondly, the car scenes are almost secondary to the fabulous story and character development in the film. The script (also by Edgar Wright) is just brilliant. There are genuinely laugh-out loud moments in the movie, with one of the highlights for me being JD tasked with procuring Michael Myers \"Halloween\" masks for a heist. If you don't find this scene hilarious, you are not human \u2013 official.Elgort is really strong in the lead role, and suggested to me that if the role of the young Han Solo in the upcoming Star Wars spin-off hadn't already gone to Alden Ehrenreich, then here was a very strong contender.\u00a0 All of the supporting roles are strong (as you would expect from such a stellar cast) with Jon Hamm being a standout, appearing truly demonic in the closing scenes. \u00a0The one role I was less sure about in the film was that of Lily James, whose performance as the 'sweet as apple pie' waitress seemed a little too \"animated\" for the big screen in the early scenes - I remember an acting class by Michael Caine where he advised that given the size of the movie screen 'stillness was good' sometimes. What works well on the small screen (I am a big fan of her roles in historical TV dramas like \"Downton Abbey\" and the impeccable \"War and Peace\") perhaps sometimes needs modifying for the wide-screen experience. I greatly warmed to her portrayal in the action sequences later on though: she's a great actress and one that this film can hopefully now propel into the higher echelons in Hollywood.Another star of the film is the fabulous soundtrack coordinated by Oscar-winner Steven Price (\"Gravity\") featuring (amongst many other classics) Queen's \"Brighton Rock\", Golden Earring's \"Radar Love\", the Simon and Garfunkel classic (obviously) and Bob & Earl's \"Harlem Shuffle\", all used to brilliant effect.\u00a0 This latter track leads me on to some early Oscar predictions:\u00a0 if this film doesn't get nominated this year for Oscars for Best Editing (Jonathan Amos and Paul Machliss, \"Scott Pilgrim vs the World\") and Best Sound Editing (Julian Slater), then there is no God! The \"Harlem Shuffle\" coffee run sequence is a masterclass in editing and direction.\u00a0 Starting off with what I thought might turn into a tribute to \"Saturday Night Fever\", the scene neatly takes on a style all of its own. It's use of \u2013 erm \u2013 \"subtitles\" is just brilliant.The often subtle, and occasionally not so subtle, edits between scenes are also truly masterful, making this moviegoer laugh-out-loud with delight periodically at the movie-making skill on display.All of this is orchestrated by Edgar Wright as director who \u2013 for me \u2013 has been a little inconsistent over the years (loved, loved, loved \"Shaun of the Dead\" and \"Hot Fuzz\";\u00a0 \"The World's End\" \u2013 not so much).\u00a0 Here, he delivers in spades and this film rockets immediately into my Films of the Year list for 2017.\u00a0 Awe inspiring.\u00a0Beg, steal, borrow, rob a bank - - do what you have to, but make sure you catch this film on the big screen.(For the full and graphical version of this review please visit bob- the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook. Thanks.)"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Wow. Baby Driver might just be the best film director Edgar Wright has ever crafted. An exhilarating ride, Baby Driver serves as a showcase for Wright to combine everything he's learned in the director's chair up to this point, from quick-witted humor to high-octane action sequences and everything in between. Over twenty years in the making, from the first frame to the last, Wright's film fires on all cylinders in a glorious exercise of style.The film follows Baby (Ansel Elgort), a young getaway driver with tinnitus who constantly plays music to drown out the sound. To be fair, I wasn't quite sold on the film when I first heard about it. While I was intrigued by the premise, I didn't know quite how Wright would pull it off. But after the fantastic Three Flavors Cornetto trilogy and the criminally underrated Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Wright has knocked it out of the park for a fifth straight time, something I should have never doubted was possible. While I've heard other compare the film to 2011's Drive (but funnier) or 2016's La La Land (but with car chases), I actually think they're doing the film a disservice. Only Wright, a unique talent who continues to solidify himself as one of today's best directors, could have conceived of the spectacle featured in the film.Gone are the quirky British settings of Wright's previous films, with the whole of Baby Driver set in Atlanta. While I was a bit skeptical about this change, seeing as how a major part of my love for the films of the Three Flavors Cornetto trilogy had been their setting in England, Wright immediately sets the tone from the get-go, opening with a thrilling bank robbery sequence that includes a well-executed long take. The pressure just builds from there, as Wright crafts chases and shootouts with technical flair and superb skill. Bill Pope, who previously collaborated with Wright on The World's End and Scott Pilgrim, captures the proceedings beautifully, his superb camera-work showing through every scene. Visually stunning, Baby Driver is a wonder to behold on the big screen.Perhaps the most impressive of the film's many technical aspects is the editing, handled expertly by the duo of Jonathan Amoss and Paul Machliss. Wright's carefully curated soundtrack works perfectly in conjunction with whatever's on screen, allowing for the film to develop a unique, energetic rhythm unlike anything I've seen. And as for the soundtrack itself, it's one of the film's many assets, with Wright mixing songs both new and old to great sonic effect. Additionally, Wright makes sure that every song serves a purpose, allowing each one of them to shine.Baby Driver, however, isn't a conventional action film by any means. Remember, this an Edgar Wright film after all. The way the story unfolds allows for more than a few twists and turns that managed to keep me enthralled. Additionally, I was surprised that a supporting character's presence was entirely left out of the trailers. Considering marketing's propensity to leave no stone unturned when it comes to a film's trailers, it was refreshing to see that was not the case here. While I won't spoil who that character is, I will say that they help ground the story by providing an emotional tether for both Elgort and the audience that becomes indispensable the more I think about it.While the film undoubtedly belongs to Elgort in the lead role, who does a tremendous job acting opposite so many established stars, I was thoroughly surprised by how much I enjoyed Jon Hamm's role. Hamm simply owns it as Buddy. While Jamie Foxx might be more of a scene- stealer as the unpredictable Bats, it's Buddy that truly kept me on the edge of my seat. However, Foxx shines as well, delivering a performance entirely unhinged and yet, wholly believable. As for the rest of the cast, Lily James shines as well, bringing a lightness to the proceedings that provides a nice balance to the hardened criminals that make up the rest of the cast. Kevin Spacey atones for the sins of Nine Lives here, as the leader of the criminal outfit that Baby drives for. Spacey makes for a great criminal leader, delivering another electric performance in a career full of them. And Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez, who plays Buddy's wife Darling, turns in a solid turn as well, fierce and sensual in equal measure. While a slight part of me wishes that certain cast members had received more screen time, I do commend Wright for presenting a straightforward story that does not stumble over its own excess.As for the story itself, some might be surprised to find that Wright's focus here isn't so much on the humor, with the film having perhaps the darkest tone of all of his films. Whereas in his previous films, the death of a character was usually treated with humor and levity, the stakes here are definitely higher. However, make no mistake, the clever writing that has shaped each of Wright's previous films remains intact. While Wright's emphasis does shift a bit more towards delivering genuine thrills than I was expecting, he succeeds graciously. But both the thrills and humor are all in service of one thing: Wright's script. And with his script, Wright accomplishes his goal of delivering an entertaining, rollicking crime romp complete with a fantastic soundtrack and well-rounded characters.Wright is simply at the top of his directorial game here. His directorial trademarks, from the way he handles transitions to the sublime usage of visual storytelling, are all here and put to splendid use. But above all, Baby Driver is kinetic entertainment, a bright spot in an otherwise mediocre summer movie season. I walked out of the theater feeling electrified, eager for another opportunity to see the film again. Simply put, Baby Driver is the most fun I've had at the theater in a long, long time.Rating: 10/10 (Masterpiece)"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Everything about the film is pretty much pitch perfect if you ask me. Lets start with the cars. I have not been a fan of Fast and Furious films, but the chase scenes in this film run circles around that series if a certain reality of the moves matters to you. This is more in line with Bullit,French Connection, and the Italian Job films as far as great chases.The music, fun, simply fun. Songs from every decade of my lifetime. Action best pure adrenaline action in years. You will be truly on the edge of your seat during much of the film.Humor, what can I say, love Edgar Wright's humor and this is his best.And oh what a cast! Loved every one of the leads performances. I think Ansel was a standout, but come on Jamie Foxx, Spacey, Hamm and the beautiful Lily James. And the other leading lady, Eiza Gonzalez, was unknown to me, but she was great with one terrific diner speech in particular. I was lucky enough to see this at an early screening in Denver. I will be seeing this in the theaters once again when it opens, and I very rarely watch movies more than once.Sometimes when I see a review fawning over a film like this, I think troll. Best way to check that out is see how many films the reviewer has reviewed and rated. I have over 4,000 rated films here. Not a lot of tens either.Best film so far this year."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "\"Baby Driver\" the new film from Edgar Wright is about a getaway driver named Baby who is forced to work for a criminal mastermind who hires different teams to rob banks. When Baby meets the girl of his dreams, he wants out, but not before being double crossed and forced to work on an other job.Edgar Wright's films are brilliant. I will say that first. They are all funny, original, and relatable. \"Baby Driver\" is no different. This may actually be the best Edgar Wright film I have seen (excluding The World's End, which I have NOT seen). This is up there for as one of the best and could be in the running for my favorite movie of the year when all is said and done at the end of the year. First off, the cast is phenomenal and perfectly cast. I have not seen Ansel Elgort in anything else, but he was really good in the movie. Everyone in this movie really gave it their all. Jon Hamm in this movie, HOLY SMOKES. Even Eiza Gonzalez, thought not great, did a very good job and gave it their all.This movie is very original, something there isn't much of these days. It is so well written and you are able to get sucked into this world very easily. The script is very witty, funny, original, and relatable. The characters are not overly developed, but not underdeveloped either. It's just the right amount of characterization.This movie goes in many ways I did not expect. This movie sets up a character to be the main villain and he doesn't end up being the main villain, which I would usually have a problem with but I felt it worked very well for this movie. It wasn't predictable, and usually movies like this are. This one wasn't. it kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat for the entirety of it. Th action is really cool too, and yes there is some shaky cam, but I feel as if it is shaky cam done right. You can still make out what is going on in each scene even when the camera is shaking. the action is just so inventive and cool, as unrealistic as it may be, and it made these scenes really entertaining and fun to watch.This movie also has a killer soundtrack. The soundtrack for this movie is the perfect driving music. It was fun to listen to, and added a little extra to the action scenes. This was by far one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard for a movie. Please do yourselves a favor and see this film next weekend when it comes out. this is what Hollywood needs right now, original films that aren't afraid to push the envelope. This movie was a whole lotta fun. I had a blast with it at my screening, and is definitely up there for best of the year so far.I'm giving \"Baby Driver\" the almighty perfect score of an A+Check out my review of \"Baby Driver\" on YouTube in the link provided, and please, go and support this movie. I went to a press screening for this so it was free but I will be more than happy to keep paying to see this movie or anything original multiple times in theaters.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rmr2i8MxgA"}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "Let me cut to the chase: this movie is awesome! Pure and simple. Edgar Wright is a f*cking genius. What he is able to do in crafting this movie is just mindblowing. It is so slick and razor sharp, that I had a hard time thinking about just how much work actually went into the production design, the editing, the cinematography, the sound editing, and the direction in order to have everything run as smoothly as it did. I'd say there is music playing for about 75% of this movie, and it isn't just some random pop songs playing in the background. The movie is entirely constructed around its soundtrack. Every frame, every shot, and every action happens to perfectly coincide with the music. And it's edited to a T! It is stylized in the best way, and it just comes across as a beautiful orchestra of visual awesomeness. If you look in the background, you can see graffiti on the buildings that has some of the song lyrics, and its timed that you hear it in the song as Baby walks past this graffiti. That's the level of care and attention that went into every shot of this movie, and I was blown away by it. There were elegant long shots that you could tell were endless rehearsed and prepped in order to flow seamlessly with the music. There are few movies where I genuinely don't know how they did or pulled something off, and this is one of those movies."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "I caught a premiere of this movie in May, thanks to Sony pictures, and UC San Diego. I never thought a free movie could be THIS good.First of all, this is an Edgar Wright movie. That itself should make you go to the theatre. The story is quite simple - A good guy is unfortunately stuck in a world of crime as a getaway driver. He needs to pull one last job before he elopes with his girlfriend. But the story is never the most important thing in an Edgar Wright movie. The razor sharp humour, the amazing soundtrack, and the gorgeous visuals bear his signature. This Edgar Wright-ness is the film's USP. And, the stunts, OMG !! The stunt/chase sequences in this movie put all the 8 Fast and Furious movies to shame (I wasn't a fan to begin with).I can't give you a single reason to NOT watch this movie. IT IS phenomenal. So, go for it ! It's the Wright way to start this summer."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Director Edgar Wright's newest and most outwardly conventional film Baby Driver is nothing short of a new definition in cool. Aided by an eclectic soundtrack, a stylish and engrossing caper story and Wright's meticulously crafted look and feel, the film soars like rarely a movie of this stripe has soared before. At its height Baby Driver feels like the mordant composure of a Jean-Pierre Melville's crime thriller is being spun around on a Looney Tune Acme thingamajig. It sounds like it shouldn't work but after seeing what is most definitely the best crime comedy in years, having this particular mix of awesome is the equivalent of accidentally getting chocolate in your peanut butter.The film sets itself at the center of a criminal underworld dominated by greed and ego. Yet the world of Baby (Elgort) feels unnaturally bright by comparison. And why shouldn't it be; He's only a job or two away from retiring as an infinitely skilled getaway driver. A driver whose handler (Spacey) trusts him enough to shuttle his various criminal enterprises in and around the Atlanta downtown loop. \"I never work with the same crew twice, except for you,\" says Spacey in a rare moment of rare avuncular appreciation. Baby in-turn answers with Monsters, Inc. (2001) quotes. He's one foot out the door and clearly happy to be.As with all movies of this kind, things don't go exactly according to plan. A plot point that looms larger as Baby starts dating a peppy waitress named Debora (James) who shares his love of music. It's a love of necessity as the music is used to drown out his tinnitus, as well as having the duel purpose of being getaway driving focus fuel and a framing device for the audience.And what remarkably obsessive frames we end up going through. To point out that Baby Driver has a handful of incredible car chases verges on the obvious. Yet what the trailer might not tell you about are the various visual and audio cues that create an echo chamber of gags, setups, callbacks, pacing devices and tension builders. They're meant to please the ears and tickle the brain and boy do they ever. In one moment of frazzled suspense, the sound mixing erupts in a cacophony of gunfire, sneaker squeaks, screaming on-lookers and the non-diegetic guitar riffs of \"Hocus Pocus\" blaring on Baby's iPod. In other scenes the body language of supporting cast members sync up perfectly with whatever Baby is listening to, hinting to a heightened reality that only Baby experiences in the recesses of his headphones. Baby Driver is not strictly speaking a musical, but it might as well be.In the hands of any other director, Baby Driver still would have been good, perhaps edging out The Italian Job (2003) in its ability to balance fast fun and elevating stakes. Yet in the hands of Edgar Wright (who also wrote the screenplay), Baby Driver feels alive, tight, tactile and dare I say even original. It's an exercise in style that zips by with such eye-popping aplomb and works on so many levels that I'm honestly surprised the reigns of this beast didn't slip out of Wright's hands. This movie could have easily been another Transformers (2007) i.e. visually resplendent but far too slapdash for its strengths to be appreciated.No - this movie wants to be appreciated. It wants to be oogled at and admired and further distills its energy with a supporting cast that either meets or exceed it. Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Eiza Gonzalez, Jamie Foxx, Jon Bernthal, Lanny Joon and Flea all do wonders playing the various psychotics that encircle Baby like a murder of crows. Their characterizations are buoyant as a whole with Hamm and Gonzalez standing out as a criminal couple whose psychosis is just this side of Bonnie and Clyde (1967).Then of course there's Ansel Elgort who often feels like a millennial remix of the cool, detached, petty criminal trope made famous by Alain Delon's trademark smolder. Here his detachment hides a vulnerability - a hidden need to find life outside of crime, a deep desire to not see anyone get hurt and of course his creative outlet. An outlet that refreshingly switches off his defenses and gets him to instantly dance like no one is watching.If there is one sour note in this car chase opera, it's the romance. While the rest of the film owns its stylistic excesses, the budding romance between Baby and Debora is played straight and more than a little syrupy. What's worse is because the character of Debora largely lacks depth or agency, huge swaths of the second act feel like we're setting up the marbles and levers of a rube-goldberg machine with Debora being one of said marbles.Yet when everything is in motion, Baby Driver can't help but be an incredible romp. Nearly everything to this movie fires on all cylinders. And in the drivers seat is arguably one of the most fertile and creative movie minds of the 21st century. Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007), Scott Pilgrim (2010), World's End (2013) and now this? Seriously what can't Edgar Wright do?"}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Baby Driver is one hell of a film,I was lucky enough to go to preview of this film and it was worth it.This film uses music the way no other film has ever, It's stylish and has a cast that bring it to life especially Ansel Elgort,Jamie Foxx,Jon Hamm and Kevin Spacey bring a performance that almost tops all their others.The film has exciting car chases and intense moments that leave you on the edge of your seat just acing to know what happens,the final act is probably where Baby Driver shines in all it's glory.Period. Overall this film is a film for everyone,it has music that makes you want to get up and dance right there in the theater.I give Baby Driver a 10/10,go and see it now."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "Greetings again from the darkness. If his movies are any indication, writer/director Edgar Wright would be fun to hang out with. He thrives on action and humor, and seems committed to making movies that are entertaining, rather than philosophical life statements. Many know his work from Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End), while others are fans of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. High concept, high energy and a creative use of music are identifiable traits within Mr. Wright's films, all of which are crucial to the success of his latest.Ansel Elgort (excellent in The Fault in Our Stars) stars as Baby, a freakishly talented getaway driver paying off a debt to a no-nonsense crime boss Doc played by Kevin Spacey. Baby has an unusual movie affliction \u2013 a childhood accident killed his parents and left him with tinnitus. He compensates for the constant ringing in his ear by listening to music through ear buds attached to one of his many iPods (depending on his mood). In fact, his insistence on finding just the right song for the moment adds a colorful element to each escape route.The film opens with what may be its best car chase scene and the hyper-kinetic approach sets the stage for something a bit different than what we usually see. There are no car drops from airplanes or train-jumping (I'm looking at you Fast and Furious franchise). Instead these are old school chases in the mode of Bullitt, or more precisely, Walter Hill's 1978 The Driver (Mr. Hill appears briefly here as a courtroom reporter). A heist-romance-chase film with a diverse and truly remarkable selection of songs, high energy, more than a few comedic moments (the Mike Myers mask sequence is brilliant) and a recurring Monsters, Inc quote requires a strong lead, and young Mr. Elgort aces the test. Baby is the DJ to his own life, and possesses a moral compass that others on his jobs can't comprehend. It's a heart of gold in a bad spot.Spacey plays Doc with his chilling dead-eyed stare, and even has his own moment of action sporting an automatic weapon during a violent shootout. Spacey's various crime teams (he varies the pairings) include psycho-lovebirds Buddy (Jon Hamm in his continuing effort to distance from Don Draper) and Darling (Eiza Gonzalez), Jon Bernthal, Flea, and an aptly named Bats (Jamie Foxx), who is not the clearest thinker of the bunch. Other supporting work comes courtesy of the rarely seen songwriter/actor Paul Williams, musician Sky Ferreira (as Baby's beloved mother), young Brogan Hall as Doc's talented nephew, and CJ Jones as Baby's foster father. Mr. Jones is one of the few deaf movie actors and he adds much to Baby's life outside of crime.The crucial role of Baby's love interest goes to the very talented and likable Lily James (Pride and Prejudice and Zombies) as singing waitress Debora, who introduces him to Carla Thomas' \"B-A-B-Y\" song, while he plays \"Debora\" from T.Rex for her. She and Baby share the not overly ambitious life plan: \"to head west in a car I can't afford and a plan I don't have\". They are good together and that helps make up for the always cringe-inducing red flag of \"one last job\" prior to the lovers running away together.Buried in the Miscellaneous Crew is Choreographer Ryan Heffington, who deserves at least some of the credit for the most unique and creative aspect of the presentation. This appears to be a movie fit to the music, rather than music fit to the movie. There are some astounding sequences where the drum/bass beats are right on cue with the action \u2013 gunfire, driving, and character movements. \"Harlem Shuffle\" plays as Baby playfully dances past graffiti and sidewalk obstacles that perfectly match the beat and lyrics. We see what is likely the best ever movie use of \"Bellbottoms\", and without question, the most creatively brilliant use of \"Hocus Pocus\" by Focus. At times exhilarating to the senses, the infusion of comedy shots and new love help offset the tension of crime jobs and the thrill of the chase."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Baby Driver is the latest film from Edgar Wright.

This is definitely a fun film anyone of any demographic can have a good time with seeing as how to juggles all these different genres in a balanced way. Where the film succeeds the most is style and tone. The \"feel\" of this movie is consistent throughout its runtime and never tries to be anything than it's not. Musical elements are utilized to its fullest capacity by creating an almost music video vibe that strangely never becomes annoying but rather helps tell the story and engage the audience. Every scene with every piece of music feels completely intentional and never feels misplaced which gives the script and the talented cast room to shine their brightest. Fans of well developed characters and solid plot writing will find little to complain about this as well. Despite this being a straightforward crime/action flick, characters are well flushed out and the story itself is gripping to the point where you can't take your eyes off the screen. With the exception of one character decision that didn't get enough set up or pay off, every character is believable and portrayed wonderfully. The only restraints one might have with this movie is its unoriginality in its main character arc. If the viewer has seen enough crime films they'll know (or at least can predict) how it'll go and turn out for our hero. It also lacked some character pay off as mentioned before which can take a few people out of the movie. That being said, its execution feels so fresh that it's easy to forget you're watching a film you've seen before. Even after viewing, it still feels fresh and deserving of another viewing because of how much fun and care went into making this picture."}, {"score": "5/10", "review": "Yes, it starts strong and manages to carry a lot of that momentum forward even somewhat beyond the midway point. But the small flaws that I was willing to overlook up to that point become huge issues as its believability is getting stretched to the breaking point.I was raised for the first thirteen years of my life in the South, so the Southern accents were a major problem for me. Ansel Elgort seems to drop it whenever it's convenient for him. In a few scenes in which he converses with Lily James in a diner they are both using the accent surprisingly well, then it's just dropped out almost completely beyond that point. Throughout the movie it ranges from very deep to nonexistent. Annoying.Also, Jon Hamm's performance was usually quite painful. He could not portray a tough guy to save his life. I felt like he was in an SNL sketch and was going to burst into laughter at his own incompetence at trying to play a thug at any moment. I enjoyed seeing him only when he and his lady friend (Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez) were shooting up their rivals. In fact, I wish that Gonz\u00e1lez had far more screen time in this movie because she played her role in such a sexy-yet-convincing manner.There was a PAINFUL twist in which Kevin Spacey's \"Doc\" character does a complete 180 in his personality, which wasn't warranted by anything. And he does it with one of the most clich\u00e9d lines in cinematic history-- \"I was in love once.\" It's like Edgar Wright just decided near the end that he didn't like his character anymore and wanted to flip his ways completely without any real justification. It took me out of it completely.Also, Lily James's Debora character seems as if she is willing to follow the \"Baby\" character through the depths of hell, which would be difficult to believe even if they had known each other for a few years. She knew him for *a few days.* Wholly unrealistic. Wholly unbelievable.Jamie Foxx was great. He does a great job of portraying an impossibly annoying, malicious jerk. He reminds me of so many Lyft passengers who I've picked up this year.It's mildly entertaining. It's mildly enjoyable. But there was nothing here that justifies an 8+ point rating on IMDb or 98% on Rotten Tomatoes."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "I was able to watch Baby Driver during an advanced screening last week and and yes it's as amazing as the critics say it is. The way it uses the music is just so great. It's so different from all the other movies, but it isn't artsy in a way that only the critics will like it: this is a movie for everyone. I went with a friend who is really hard to please when it comes to movies, but I just knew he would love this. And I was right, I never saw him as excited about a movie as he was about this one. It's just so much fun to watch, but it's also serious when it needs to be and it has very intriguing characters. But I'll be honest, the core of the movie is its music. I think this is the second time I say it, but the music works so well. If I wasn't in the theaters I would sing with the songs. Even though it's completely different, it reminds me a bit of Fury Road in the way that it makes you want to punch your fist and the air and cheer during the movie. In reality I think it's more a mixture of La La Land and Grand Theft Auto (it's definitely not a musical by the way). Go see this movie. I don't want to overhype anyone, but I'll make a bold statement and say this is my favorite Edgar Wright movie. I'll be shocked if this doesn't appear on many 'Best of the Year' lists in December, at least I already know it'll be on mine."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "So wanted to like this. I'm a massive fan of Wright's previous work and he can make good films that don't star Pegg and Frost (see Scott Pilgrim) but Baby Driver just didn't work for me. I think it has to do with expectations. Baby Driver just doesn't have the winning goofiness of Wright's other work and just came over as loud and obnoxious. The characters, bar Baby and Debora are totally unlikable and the 'music' concept is stretched way too thin. Wright seems to abandon it too as the film devolves into a shouty, sweary, shooty denouement that we've seen a million times before. I can't understand the critical praise heaped on this film. I think it has maybe presented something of a palette cleanser for critics who've been CGI'd to death this summer, but personally I was really disappointed."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "It's a bad summer for movies. But one film is about to rise from the ashes and show us all how it's done. Edgar Wright never disappoints, and he's done it again with Baby Driver. This is no clich\u00e9d action flick. What Wright does here is innovative and badass. It's set to a groovy soundtrack of vinyl crackling hits, mostly from the early sixties. The bullets fly and the cars skid in sync with the songs. The opening sequence of the film is nearly a masterpiece. Right from the first five minutes, you are in love with Baby.. yeah, that's his name. The silent hero who communicates through his first-gen iPod shuffle. There are scenes and characters who needed some more fleshing out, like Baby's love interest. But overall, we've found the diamond in the rough of 2017."}]
