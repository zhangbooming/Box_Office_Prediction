[{"score": "6/10", "review": "The Mummy franchise has been struggling lately. Ever since the original 1999 movie was released, the movies have gradually gotten worse. The first \"Mummy\" was slick, well made and entertaining; the second was your typical B/C movie, not the worst but far from the best, and then with the third installment it was clear that Hollywood had given up on the franchise and wanted one more pay-cheque. Skip forward to 2017 and we appear to have something just as good as the original. Sure, for some, the flashy visuals may seem like a cover-up for the (occasional) uninspired dialogue, however, there is no doubt that a lot of money was invested in making this film look good, and it sure delivers on that aspect (even with The Scorpion King setting the bar very low, \"The Mummy\" (2017) still looks pretty amazing). Tom Cruise stars, which to some may be a turn-off, but I think some credit is due here. Tom has made a name for himself in the M:I film's, and with his performance in \"The Mummy\", he shows audiences that perhaps it's not too late to make a name for yourself in a different franchise. He's not the best actor in the world by any means, but he does the job and he does it well enough for the film to be taken reasonably seriously. I think that it's important to remember that you're not seeing anything ground- breaking with this film; it's not going to have the same impact as the original Mummy title and it certainly isn't going to steal the show at the Oscars, but it has its moments of adrenaline-pumping action, well-crafted visuals and smart dialogue. Some of this 1hr 47min Egyptian-fetish flick feels a bit clunky, and the story is all too familiar sounding (disturbing an ancient evil which comes back to wreak havoc on everyone), but when you consider that there have been worse Mummy films, 2 to be exact and that Alien Covenant hasn't exactly set the bar for reboots particularly high, The Mummy has its entertainment value, it has its action and suspense, but it also has some cracks in its sarcophagi which will, hopefully, be ironed out when they inevitably make another of these in 2 or so years time. Not the worst, not the best, but definitely worth watching for a few thrills.Parental Guidance: Some scary scenes, moments of moderate fantasy horror and bloody violence, language (15+)"}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "I give this an 8, not because I think the film is super by any means...but because I am still hopeful. Universal Dark/Dark Universe has extreme promise for anyone that loves the B+W classics. Saying that - this first movie is nothing but recycled American cheese. Its like they merged Brendan Fraser's Mummy with Nicholson's A National Treasure and claimed it is 'something new'.As I said, I still remain hopeful.....but I am hopeful that there is less American cheese in the next one. I wish a British director like Nolan got his hands on this. This concept could have been nothing but suspense instead of cheese.I know it is hard to translate the original B+W movies for a modern audience, but they could have at least tried a Hitchcockian vibe. They could have brought in horror movie greats as producers. They could have tried a classic music score for it that would encompass the whole movie...but nothing.We have already had \"good family fun popcorn action movies\"....more than we need with Fox, Marvel and DC.

It feels more like sitting in a dentist's waiting room as opposed to rockin' on a roller coaster ride. And Tom Cruise is just wrong for this role, a huge case of miscast. Perhaps they should just press the reboot button again.Sofia Boutella plays an evil ancient princess imprisoned in a tomb deep beneath the unforgiving desert. When a couple of treasure hunters and an archaeologist awaken her in our present day, she returns to life to reclaim her destiny while at the same time unleashing unimaginable terrors in this new take that ushers in a new world of gods and monsters. Co-starring Tom Cruise, Annabelle Wallis, Russell Crowe and Jake Johnson, directed by Alex Kurtzman.The concept of what the writers and director Alex Kurtzman is trying to present to us with \"The Mummy\" is nothing new, in fact it's quite predictable, but the biggest problem about it is that along the way from point A to point B, they fill it in with moments that just don't work. And it gets even more frustrating when they bring it up again the second, third and fourth time as if shoving it down our throats would make it better. The jokes fall flat so much so you kinda feel sorry for Jake Johnson who clearly wants to make some effort as this film's comic relief. There are also parts that are just absolutely pointless and unnecessary. The characters including Dr. Jekyll frequently draw conclusions out of their butts. I do think \"The Mummy\" is what happens when the story is forced to serve the visual spectacle instead of the other way around. That said, rising star Sofia Boutella is a marvelous choice, she exudes that thirst for power effortlessly in addition to being incredibly seductive.But of course, just as expected, instead of it being a movie about Sofia Boutella's The Mummy, it becomes all about Tom Cruise, who as I said earlier is just awfully wrong for this role. I understand that the studios probably think that banking on a A-lister would translate into box office results, but fact of the matter is outside \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise, Cruise just doesn't fit anywhere else anymore. The character that he plays here is is a thieving treasure hunter, much like Nathan Drake from \"Uncharted\" games, but all you see on the screen instead is special agent Ethan Hunt desperately trying to be someone he's not. By the end of \"The Mummy\" you're going to have second thoughts about anticipating the next installment of this Dark Universe, and you're going to want to wish Brendan Fraser had still been around.-- Rama's Screen --"}, {"score": "3/10", "review": "Although the other actors gave a good performance, Tom Cruise's acting was subpar. Aside from this, the script was horrendous. It was extremely stiff and unnatural. You can tell when someone's acting is good, but the problem lies with the script. This is pretty much what happened in this movie.The script is so awkward and unnatural that it overshadowed the actors' performances.Although I already had my doubts after seeing the trailer, I saw the 7 star rating on IMDb and decided to give it a shot. \"Maybe it won't be that bad,\" I thought. \"Maybe it's just that the trailer wasn't put together well.\"I thought wrong.Another problem I had with the script was that it was clear that the scriptwriter(s) wanted to make one-liners that would become household phrases (e.g. \"You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\" - The Dark Knight). Unfortunately, not only did this endeavor fail, but it failed badly.If you're looking for an action movie involving mummies, I would suggest you watch \"The Mummy (1999)\" and \"The Mummy Returns (2001)\".

This Tom Cruise-led reboot of the 1999 Mummy delivers the thrills, action, and scares all in one package. Believe me I had low expectations prior to seeing this film. It had underwhelming trailers and sparse marketing but man was I wrong in judging this movie beforehand. The Dark Universe introduces us to their unique element that differs from its superhero rivals. Horror.What I like about this film is that it never really bored me. Pacing was was well done and a lot of stuff may happen at once. There were some few monologues here and there but it does not distract the experience. Cinematography was good, as a guy who loves astounding camera-work there were some shots that made the villain (Sofia Boutella) look so beautiful. The tricky part is the acting, Tom Cruise was good at some scenes especially intense moments but felt he could do more in his role. Supporting characters were good but no noteworthy performances (sorry Russell Crowe). A breakthrough for Sofia Boutella as this is her first proper film hope we can see more of her in other projects.A fine start on the Dark Universe.

I am used to watch movies, that is included mummy inside it, they are scary. But for this time, this movie is not like a horror, nor scary movie and I can tell you why. The first is about the title. I can imagine about the title, that is simple, straightforward, and not so surprising. The title is \"The Mummy\", so basically the mummy that will lead all the plots. In fact, you will believe me and you can write review after watching it, that the mummy is not really a central of the plots. Yet, the unnecessary appearances of the mummy, which is a lot to happen. Well, I really do not know whether the Director is really learning about Egyptian history, but the movie shows the mummy has the power somehow like a zombie. This is the weakest part of this movie. Mummy is not definitely a zombie! You can figure out also the figure of the mummy. She is not so scary, even for me, Indonesians or Thailand's ghosts are more scarier. Besides, Tom Cruise here is not playing smoothly, from beginning to the end. There is no serious talk, nor surprise scenes, nor romantic comedy, as he habitually played. The role of Russel Crow himself is also not so well. The movie can go, without the role of him. The other thing that I want to critic is about the ending. Wow, you will be disappointed. In brief, this movie is not a must-watch. This is a boring movie. You can watch later. Sorry, Tom Cruise. You can be better."}, {"score": "3/10", "review": "\"The Mummy\" is the first movie in what Universal Studios wants to call their \"Dark Universe.\" Yeah, that's right. Those re-shoots that 2014's \"Dracula Untold\" went through to tie into a Dark Universe; those don't matter now. That 2010 Benicio del Toro \"Wolfman\" movie; also doesn't matter. In a world where Universes are becoming more and more of a thing, Universal seems determined not to let this monster mash-up of The Wolfman, Dracula, Frankenstein, Mummy, Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde and more slip through their fingers. And they're also not skimping out on finding A-list talent to help sell the whole thing. So far we've heard Johnny Depp, The Rock, and Javier Bardem's names being thrown into the mix, plus Russell Crowe is already here as Dr. Jekyll. That last one I think is really cool by the way because while so many others have been portrayed by the likes of Gary Oldman and Jack Nicholson's, Jekyll's best portrayal in the past 20+ years has been ugh\u0085.David Hasselhoff. But now let's talk about \"The Mummy\", specifically that old trilogy with Brendan Fraser. There's no doubt director Stephen Sommers lucked out with that first film and there's also little doubt Universal wants to move away from that overall cheesiness here. The question is can they still go serious but also have fun at the same time?And say what you will about Sommers; the guy was a C-grade filmmaker who got a kick out of a cheap thrill but at least you could say he committed to it. This new Mummy is just a wrong-headed disaster. The set-up is pretty much the same as the older Mummy film although here it's a woman played by \"Kingsman's\" Sofia Boutella. She's Ahmanet, an Egyptian Princess who wanted power, sold out to some powerful entity for eternal life, and paid for it by getting entombed.Universal of course is also putting it's faith in Tom Cruise, who plays an Army Vet prone towards treasure hunting. He and several others find Ahmanet's sarcophygus but while bringing it back to be examined, the plane goes down over London and a bunch of strange things happen that they learn can't just be coincidence. This is Cruise just being Cruise here. He gets to run around a lot doing his \"intense face\" all while an attractive woman half his age is along with him for the sexual interplay (more on her in a moment). Yeah, there's discussion about his character growing something of a conscience as this goes on but it's pretty perfunctory.Plus having the Mummy be a woman after Cruise's body so she could plant her demon God inside of him and they can reign as King and Queen; this seems more like it falls into being of one of Cruise's aging vanity projects than on acting skill. Boutella gets very little to do otherwise but try and be seductive while waving her hands in a threatening manner. Otherwise auto-tune does the rest. The Cruise character's love interest is an archaeologist played by Annabelle Wallis who looks like she just stepped out from a Paris fashion show into an archaeological dig. Did I believe her as an archaeologist? No. Did I believe she could spell it? Sure. Either way, it doesn't matter. What does is that she and Cruise are DOA in their scenes together. No character makes much impression here, including Crowe's Dr. Jekyll who's maybe in the film for 20 minutes to explain stuff so simplistic, silly, and predictable that it hardly needs explaining at all before the film rushes through his particular ailment. For some reason screenwriters David Koepp and Christopher McQuarrie think more explanation is still warranted though and in that they couldn't be more wrong. For something trying to feel new, it's remarkably easy to tell where all this is going. Their biggest crime is what they do to New Girl's Jake Johnson, a funny actor who they turn into the Dark Universe's version of Jar Jar Binks in only five minutes. He comes in and out of the film at really odd intervals, either screaming dialogue in the hope of making it funny or giving us yet more exposition we don't really need. Add to that first time action director Alex Kurtzman is a disaster. The action sequences look haphazardly thrown together, just cartoonish and unbelievable, while a spoiler I won't give away about the Tom Cruise character makes them even harder to give a crap about anyway. The fights are stiff and uninteresting, and the special effects are either forgettable or look just as hokey as they did in the Brendan Fraser movies. The plane sequence we saw in the trailer looks pretty decent but hey, you've already seen the most decent thing in the movie, why pay to see the rest. Overall this is not just a bad film, but a film that has no idea what it even is. It wants to resurrect classic monsters, but isn't the least bit scary. It wants to take it in original directions, but winds up being an ultra-serious, dull version of the 1999 film. It's silly but not funny, it's a lot of commotion but no excitement, it's a Mummy movie that if the ending of this can even be believed, thinks it's something totally different. This is a worse start to a Universe than King Arthur was.

With the 1932 original and the fun but lazy 1999 remake and anything in between, we pretty much got it. It can be scary or it can be action packed as it seems Hollywood has left there to be no in between for this type of film. Unfortunately neither of those extremes apply to this one. The Mummy is a pandering and very meager attempt at cashing in on a potential franchise. It's sad to watch because it feels like the studio made this. This doesn't feel organic in any way, shape or form and relies on CGI filled action sequences, Tom Cruise, and cheap scares that end up being unintentionally funny to progress the story. None of which comes off the way it should.The story is absolute crap to put it as lightly as I can. It is plotted so on-the-nose that you can't have anything left up to your imagination except for some scenes of violence that may have been too much for a PG-13. Outside of that, everything is spoon fed to us as the audience. Instead of making you feel like you can keep up, the movie treats its audience like we are stupid and still expects us to continue watching. Honestly, I almost walked out at certain points, it got that bad. Especially during the scenes with Crowe's Jekyll, which are so heavily plot oriented that you can't get a feel for his character and when you get the chance to, it fails, crashes and burns.The cast is surprisingly strong on paper but director Alex Kurtzman fails to utilize them in roles that best suit them. Tom Cruise is really the only cast member that fits the part which, when considering what genre we're talking about here, is a horrible thing. Courtney B Vance, who delivered an awards caliber performance in American Crime Story, is watered down to nothing more than a mere walk on role. Russell Crowe is so obviously doing the film for the paycheck, it feels like he isn't even acting and he is just reading queue cards. As a fan of the cast and the 1932 original, I was left completely disappointed by everyone here. Director Alex Kurtzman, who went from directing a small indie to all of a sudden directing this big bombastic action summer blockbuster, feels out of his element here and misses the beats of a good action movie and completely neglects everything that could make a great horror film. The Mummy is by far one of the worst blockbusters in recent memory and stands as a major misfire for Universal's Dark Universe and Tom Cruise."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "It's here: one of the summer's notable would-be blockbusters, Tom Cruise's tender but honest account of his tumultuous relationship with his mother. (Sorry, the joke's probably more effective in spoken form.) Actually, an ancient princess (Sofia Boutella) is awakened from her crypt, and it's up to Tom Cruise to release the world of her danger, with Annabelle Wallis, Russell Crowe, Jake Johnson and others helping. Cruise didn't get to become a box-office star by being coy. He prefers to do event movies: epic and offering something that others don't, be it visuals, physical tricks, or storywise. This is why you see him in leading role usually once a year \u2013 epics need time. (Except, actually, this year, with \"American Made\" following in August.) In \u0084The Mummy's\" case, it's both visuals and tricks that should draw the people in. The 110 minute movie has plenty of furious action and some massive setpieces to get people their money's worth. The only troubled note is that critics don't seem to heart it \u2013 39/100 in Metacritic and only 25/100 in Rotten Tomatoes \u2013, with Rolling Stone calling it \u0084monster fail\", for example. I'd like to be more generous because I think the result is actually pretty entertaining. Despite the efforts to make everything look as badass and epic as possible, it's still a fun B-movie adventure at heart. They don't aim for any direct comedy, but the leading character can be clueless enough, and the events unpredictable, to earn a few smiles and winks along the way. For example, the moment of swimming underwater with a few unexpected followers. Fearing to spoil something for someone, I will not go into details, but: I also really liked mummy's servants. How they come alive, how they move and look, how they are dealt with. True, there are obvious influences to some famous videogames, but they still look fresh and creepy. And by fresh, I mean not generic. Cruise's acting seemed surprisingly cheesy at times, but this is probably intentional, and what do you expect from a monster movie anyway, eh. And this pretty old guy \u2013 53 when the filming started \u2013 can still kick ass! No reason to stop being action hero. Not that he's planning. If there's one big problem, then it's the tiresome final act which gets concerned not with properly leading the story to conclusion but creating a movie franchise for future. It goes on a bit too long and made me feel a bit exhausted. \u0084The Mummy\" is the first title in the so-called Dark Universe, or Universal's competitor to Disney/Marvel's and Warner/DC's ever- expanding world of comic-book- characters. Universal plans to bring many of its classical horrors back in cinemas, starting with \u0084Bride of Frankenstein\" and \u0084Creature from the Black Lagoon\" both coming in 2019. \u0084The Mummy\" is not probably the mightiest kick-off they could have hoped for, but I kinda like it.

I always found it generic and too obvious."}, {"score": "5/10", "review": "In the new version of The Mummy Hollywood once again shows us that when a franchise runs out of steam all you have to do is rewind and recast the movie and start all over again. The Mummy franchise had been getting steadily worse over the past few years, finally becoming a direct to DVD movie with The Scorpion King, but the Mummy (2017) makes a strong comeback with the new version staring Tom Cruise.Cruise, who made his bones as an action star in the Mission Impossible series, does a great job with the action scenes in this reboot and delivers a fine sense of humor that entertains during the slow parts of the movie while we wait for the next big round of action. Sofia Boutella is the bad girl mummy who's awakened from her eternal rest and who is hell bent on releasing the evil she has been denied during her long slumber. She haunts Nick's (Cruise) dreams with her visions of making him her sacrifice and taking her evil into all eternity with him by her side. Annabell Wallis is the female Egyptologisit who travels the world helping to prevent the evil from getting loose and Russell Crowe is the corrupt Dr. Henry Jekyll (no joke) who's the head of the ghost busting agency who has some special plans for the female mummy. The Mummy has a some incredible visual effects and enough action and humor to be entertaining but it's not a great movie.

I know that Brendan Fraser might not be the best option of doing the movie again, and I was of course psyched by the fact it would be played by Tom Cruise who was still in prime condition to play action movie. But it appeared that the movie became totally something different. this one felt too much altered.After reading some more information of the movie, I realized that this was supposed to be the start of something called Dark Universe where they would share with monsters in other universe in the future. I for one felt that the introduction towards the universe was a little bit too much emphasized. As we were hoping for a movie focusing on the Mummy, the part of the universe became a less pleasant surprise. My personal opinion is that it would probably be a lot better had it been done the way the shared universe was introduced in Kong: Skull Island, which was done in the post credit scene and hence the focus of the movie was still about King Kong.Do not get me wrong though, the movie did provide us a lot of entertaining and intense scenes. My wife literally screamed in some scenes that gave us shocking moments. What I do not like was once again the trailer of the movie revealed too much information, even the surprising scenes were shown as well which totally reduced the element of surprise when we see the actual movie. Another thing, this movie did not have any post credit scene at all despite my hope there would be one. I guess whatever they wanted to highlight, in future movies were already mentioned before the end credit scene.Coming to other aspects of the movie, the special effects of the mummy was great, the CGI was cool, the sound effects were nice (I saw this in studio with Auro 11.1 system). Jenny's character in here seemed to be too stiff and felt like a person with no expression and unfortunately did not seem to have believable chemistry with Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise was pretty good in the action scenes and also quite charming (though I still think Brendan Fraser was more suitable in this role). Sofia Boutella was pretty convincing as Ahmanet, Russel Crowe was cool as ever and my personal favorite character was Vail played by Jake Johnson, who provided the much needed humor.So all in all, if you are looking for an entertaining action adventure movie, this one was a good choice. But if you are hoping for a real movie about Mummy, then it would be best to watch the original 1999 version. Oh ya, you also need to keep an open mind if you want to enjoy this movie, especially about the Dark Universe.

Also, Ruseel Crowe's character, the head of a secret organization protecting the world from supernatural threats, fills a clich\u00e9 but provides an interesting preview of what is to come (I can't give his character name, as it would spoil the surprise).Most importantly, Sofia Boutella's re-imagined Mummy, while fulfilling clich\u00e9 monster badness, adds a certain amount of depth to her performance that propels this movie in ways that you may not expect, or if you do then at least in a manner that's satisfying rather than eye-roll worthy.Finally, it's the promise of what can be that makes this film so intriguing. Going into this film, I was skeptical as to whether or not this film could deliver on the same caliber as Iron Man for launching a cinematic universe. Now, I am intrigued by how they are going to deliver on all the teasing they do in one sequence through a vault of artifacts (also, be on the look-out for a blink-and-you-miss-it Easter egg to a previous Mummy film at about the half-way point).It's not a great film, especially given its propensity for huge time- jumps that have to be explained with fragmented dialogue as to what happened during thousands of years-worth of history.Nevertheless, The Mummy is a satisfactory launch of the Dark Universe, and I am curious for more."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "I liked it!

The storyline follows Nick Morton (Tom Cruise), who finds the crypt of Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) and flies her crypt via airplane when things go amuck. She is awakened and then controls Chris Vail (Jake Johnson) to crashes the plane. He crashes the plane to curse Nick who wakes up despite the plane crash. Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis) then hunts down Dr. Henry Jekyll (Russell Crowe) who is also looking for Princess Ahmanet and is the only who can cure Nick. However, when Ahmanet is fully formed, Nick needs to stop her from destroying London and goes to extreme levels to defeat Ahmanet and save Jenny (Annabelle Wallis).Tom Cruise is versatile in his presentation of Nick Morton who cheats people because of his own selfishness. In the battle scenes, Cruise excels in his stunt work. Sofia Boutella as Princess Ahmanet is creepy, especially as The Mummy. She really suits the character of a princess relentless seeking power. Jake Johnson as Chris Vail provides comedic relief. Annabelle Wallis as Jenny Halsey clearly presents determination in tracking down Princess Ahmanet. However, she still falls to the trope of damsel in distress. Russell Crowe as Dr. Henry Jekyll is my favorite character because he impressively presents the transition of his character.The direction by Alex Kurtzman is splendid. The pace from scene to scene is superb and kept me at the edge of my seat. My favorite scene is when Ahmanet attacks London. The special effects are outrageously impactful. My only problem is that the movie's finale is quite anti-climactic. Despite this flaw, Tom Cruise fans will rejoice at this movie.The movie's message is, even if you cheat others, you can always change to be selfless. Nick, though a thief, finds himself in the ultimate selfless sacrifice to save mankind. I give this movie 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 because of its intense horror.

The storyline was jagged, no fluidity to it.Oh sure it had some good moments (and some funny ones) and the special effects (not so much in your face but always there) propped it up but without a good story there is only so much that special effects and A-listers can do.The end was somewhat of an anti-climax and left the story very much open to continuation.

Good night out at the movies but nothing memorable whatsoever.A big issue with this movie is that there are tons of clich\u00e9s. The whole intro, story, some of the lines used have just been so over done, there really is nothing new about it. Many things also weren't explained very well and the 'in movie exposition' was too convenient. Wasn't Tom Cruises best work either, he was a pretty typical Tom Cruisey character but worse than other movies I've seen him in, he's getting a bit old to play the 'playboy'. The female leads and side character dude were probably the highlights. Worst part about the movie was the ending. Don't make a movie that will resolve/explain itself in a sequel, when the first movie hasn't proved its actually good. Maybe you have ideas in mind for the sequel and thats cool, but The Mummy basically feels like one story broken up into 2 movies. Super random and just leaves you unsatisfied at the end.Don't have a tone of positives except that it did a solid job at being a typical 'B' movieIt had a few almost thriller like moments so maybe avoid if you scare really easily."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "stephen sommers two mummy movies are classic to me they are from best action adventure movies ever saw when this reboot announce i get so excited and worried in same time because the challenge was big but thank god the movie is great the story is unique the acting from all cast is great and sofia boutella performance was brilliant best mummy ever to me tom cruise very good like every time he do action movie the best thing in this movie is horror their are some good horror scenes this movie get bad review from critics like jack reacher movie that movie was good to me and entertainment please made your own decision and don't listening to any one including me don't let any body play in your head you are not a kid"}, {"score": "2/10", "review": "There are a few times, where I would want to rush out of the cinema hall to write a review to save the souls who might want to watch it and The Mummy provides a platform to me on that sense, I am honored. All hopes were lost when the trailer was out and what a wonderful movie it could have been! With two powerful actors Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe, this movie falls just short in being a sharknado without the intention on being one! I still had hopes during various parts of the movie. For instance the opening part when Cruise is seen running firing his SCAR rifle in a desert backdrop, could it be an Uncharted(Playstation) like adventure? - No! Okay then come the pyramids, yaaay...wait is that some bad CGI? I mean they are making a 'Mummy' Movie and cant they put together at least a proper pyramids setting?! Russel Crowe, Yay...Dr.Jekyll,Yay...but wait you swapped his role from being hideous with an overweight McDonalds customer asking to choose his happy meal toy!? The CGI was very impressive - all cast in the movie were CGI which looked sooooo real, the soundtrack reminded me of 1 million action movies which releases every year made in Hollywood for audiences abroad, Tom Cruise's acting moment was when he flies around inside a jet about to crash..it was more like an extended cut with CTRL+C and CTRL+V. I can say in a heartbeat that this is definitely my favorite movie this year, OK that was just gas on my chest...Nevermind - Don't you ever consider watching this, the movie will suck your happiness like a demontor with Tom Cruise like cute face.Annabelle wallis is cute, so 2 stars."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "Not so much lousy but maybe as forgetful and unnecessary as the T- Shirts that inspired that pun. Truth be told, 2017's The Mummy is the annual Tom Cruise-led action entertainment vehicle, not offering much (if anything) in the way of originality or creativity (the amount of direct reproductions of Brendan Fraser's 1999 flick is staggering). The key difference here is that even Cruise himself, normally competent and adequate in other similar vehicles cannot hide his displacement - it is not (only) even a matter of bad and inconsequential writing, the actor himself doesn't even make much out of a clich\u00e9d character. Yet Cruise is supported on one hand by an array of forgetful, serviceable and clumsy supporting male characters (most prominently Jake Johnson's bothersome side-kick) and on the other by two competent and likable female presences in Annabelle Wallis and Sofia Boutella.With as many negatives, you would think that perhaps I disliked The Mummy more than I actually have. The truth is that despite its many shortcomings and linearities, the film is harmless mindless fun; 110 minutes that fly by as easily as a serviceable pilot episode of a B type show - the type you enjoyed yourself while watching but don't quite feel compelled to follow up on. If the planned Dark Universe franchise does kick off, its appeal is now riding on the other classical monsters and, more importantly, on who Universal chooses to helm the respective films, seen as Kurtzman is actually the main responsible for this classical monster's less than adequate revival."}, {"score": "5/10", "review": "We now live in a world where a movie about Aunt May was considered as a Spider-Man spin off by Sony at one point, as just about every studio is desperate to create their own shared cinematic universe. Universal's 'Dark Universe' sounded like a fascinating idea (and to some extent still does), but The Mummy is definitely nowhere near the opening act Universal hoped for when deciding to kick-off the series a few years ago.'The Mummy' actually has far more scares than I thought, but also far fewer high-octane action scenes than one would come to expect from a Tom Cruise led film. In reality, the movie lies somewhere in the middle of an action-horror, and that's where the film's flaws tend to reveal themselves. Although Universal has been planning this universe for years, it doesn't seem like they knew the right tone to set for the set of films. I realize going the rated R route would be a bigger risk financially, but I think there could have been more done creatively instead. Why make a Mummy film if it's just going to be a safe action thriller with nothing new to add to the lore?Alex Kurtzman, who has done some great work in both writing and producing in the past, was given a big task with directing The Mummy as his second feature film. He's not entirely to blame for the blandness of the script and direction, but he certainly didn't add anything refreshing to the long running franchise. In fact, pretty much every aspect of this film is just okay. But that isn't the type of film you should lead your entire franchise with. You should come out wanting to see more from the universe. I'm not opposed to seeing films like The Bride of Frankenstein, The Creature of the Black Lagoon, Dracula, or The Invisible Man, but they need to re-establish a more fitting tone going forward.The cast is likable, as expected. Sofia Boutella continues her streak of blockbuster success (after Kingsman & Star Trek) and does well as the creepy and seductive titular character. Annabelle Wallis is serviceable as a scientist of sorts to Dr. Jekyll's (Russel Crowe) Prodigium. And Tom Cruise is, well, Tom Cruise. The only character I felt to be out of place was Chris Vail played by Jake Johnson. He always seemed to be popping up at the wrong place and wrong time in this movie. Perhaps proposed as a comedic relief character, Vail's comedy never lands, and I hardly think it was because of Johnson's acting.Overall, I think The Mummy is a missed opportunity for Universal and their hopes of a new universe. With nothing new to add, grim tone, and a bland story, The Mummy isn't the beginning to Dark Universe I had hoped.+Acting-Tone-Dull5.0/10"}, {"score": "2/10", "review": "What a disappointment. I managed to stay for about 30 minutes, but after that it was clear there would be no resurrection. This film had nothing. It was incredibly boring. The special effects were comical. At some point I wasn't sure if this was a zombie film or really meant to be a successor to those great Mummy films, like Karloff's 1932 Universal treat or Brendan Frasers 1999 and 2001 films. I suppose it's not fair to write a review for a film you walked out on, but I rarely walk out on any film."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "What could have happened to get such a fast angry mob of movie critics and bloggers to so quickly trash The Mummy days before it came out? Well, I saw it and for the life of me could not find much to complain about.I understand that a persons opinion of a movie is just that, an opinion. Yet a couple of days ago sitting at my desk I start seeing a flood of negative reviews about The Mummy. So I read, and I read, and I continued to read words such as horrible, terrible, worst Tom Cruise movie ever, etc etc. So I decided to go to the movies today and just see this apparent train wreck of a movie. I sat there and was willing to accept what ever apparent \"garbage\" they threw at me. I mean I managed to stay through the entire Suicide Squad and I have to admit that was a mess, horrible in my opinion because they tried to cram way too many leading rolls down my throat.So after watching The Mummy do I agree with the premature flood of angry reviews? Reviews I was almost forced to endure on my many devices as if a global event was happening. I was told The Mummy was not good, not good at all in many words. Well the truth is the critics lie and apparently bullying a movie out of the box office is a live and well. I was actually quite happy with The Mummy. I liked Nicks character played by Tom Cruises who I felt was believable for a fun summer action movie. I enjoyed Jenny, co-star Annabelle Wallis who fit the roll well and did not annoy me like some actors can when it comes to 'running and screaming'. I sat through the entire movie and at one point I actually was looking for something to complain about. I personally did not like Russle Crow as Jekyll because I felt, in all honesty he was too fat for the roll. Sofia Boutella did a great job as the main villain. I could feel her feel her rage and madness and at one moment she made me jump. Guess the 3D helped there.So, what I have learned is never believe a movie critic until you see the movie for yourself."}, {"score": "8/10", "review": "First of all, I was expecting this movie to be total garbage.Second, this is definitely intended as the first of several Universal monster movie remakes, which will all take place in the same universe and have some degree of crossover. Some not too subtle nods to Jekyll and Hyde, Dracula, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Could have been more that I missed. Third, this film strays quite a bit from the original Mummy film and Fraser's Mummy movies.I was very worried about this movie. I'm a big fan of the original Universal monster films, and I was afraid that this would be another 2010 Wolfman. Thankfully, this time, the filmmakers hit the sweet spot - the movie fits well with modern audiences but pays homage to the original Universal monsters. It's not a fantastic movie, but it excels at what it is: an action monster romp and the introduction to the monster cinematic universe.The film differs quite a bit from the original: it is set in modern day, and the mummy is female. The mummy being female doesn't change things that much, although the back story is changed quite a bit. I enjoyed the new back story and found it more interesting than the one in the original film and in Fraser's. The modern day setting added something fresh: let's not forget that we have seen 3 mummy films set back several decades in Egypt. Tom Cruise plays the same sort of character that he always does, but it wasn't offensive here. Sofia is great as the mummy. Jake Johnson is enjoyable and funny, but thankfully doesn't overshadow the darker tones of the film. Russell Crowe is a treat. The other characters are serviceable. Without getting too into spoilers, this new cinematic universe seems off to a great start. The concept of monsters in the modern age is handled mostly seriously, but with the occasional humor - this topic can't be taken completely seriously after all. It isn't as dim and grim and depressing as the DC universe seems to be headed, but it is more serious and gritty than the Marvel films. A pleasant surprise. Don't expect it to hold to the original film or the Fraser movies and you'll enjoy it. And with any amount of success, there will be more monster movies to follow."}, {"score": "4/10", "review": "Arriving not long after the bland Jack Reacher sequel, this remake gives Tom Cruise a one-two punch of misfires. It's hard to tell whether this movie falls flat because it has miscast the Cruiser, or because it fails to capitalise on his charisma by surrounding him with b-grade trimmings. The first act is thrilling, opening with a rip-roaring set piece full of bullets and explosions before culminating in a spectacular free-falling aircraft sequence that sees Cruise and co-star Annabelle Wallis perform some mightily impressive stunts. But from there it is all downhill, and at a rapid rate. The tone and atmosphere shift dramatically, going from Indiana Jones-esque perilous delights to non-spooky Gothic terror that maximises its dreariness by hiding under a gloomy colour palette. Going hand in hand with the awfully drab cinematography is a sudden over-reliance on cheap CGI, the herky-jerky undead are tremendously off-putting for all the wrong reasons, whilst the London-destroying climax is a pure mess of pixels. The presence of a plethora of screenwriters is felt too, the main plot is disappointingly rote\u2014especially considering Universal are hoping this kick starts their new intertwined monster universe\u2014and the film's internal logic is flimsy at best, resulting in many of its own rules being broken for the sake of easy narrative progression. Cruise is in default enthusiastic mode, which enlivens proceedings sporadically, and Wallis is a likable hero full of pluck, however Russell Crowe is wasted as a shadowy task force leader and Sofia Boutella is reduced to hissing and shrieking as the eponymous ancient princess. The promising start demonstrates the potential The Mummy had to deliver a rollicking good time; unfortunately it only serves to highlight just how dull and unsatisfying the rest of the movie really is."}, {"score": "1/10", "review": "\"The Mummy\" (PG-13, 1:50) is the first film in Universal Studios' modern Dark Universe franchise. And why not? There's a lot of money to be made taking characters and properties with an established fan base and turning them into a string of modern feature films. Marvel Studios has its Marvel Cinematic Universe, Warner Bros. has the DC Extended Universe and Disney has Star Wars. Universal's plan to get in on the game? Updating the horror, suspense and science fiction movies that they've held the rights to since before movies could talk. As the silent film era waned and talkies replaced them, Universal released classics such as \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (both starring Lon Chaney, Sr.), followed by \"Dracula\" (starring Bela Lugosi), then \"Frankenstein\" and \"The Mummy\" (both with Boris Karloff). Universal's original Dark Universe series continued through the 1950s, with several other monsters \u2013 and sequels to their more popular movies. Then there were sporadic cinematic appearances of these characters in early 21st century remakes, such as the underrated \"Dracula Untold\" (2014), \"The Wolfman\" (2010), \"Van Helsing\" (2004) and, of course, Brendan Fraser's \"Mummy\" movies (1999 and 2001). At Universal, in the mid-late 2010s, a plan emerged and the umpteenth\u0085 incarnation of \"The Mummy\" is the first step. The studio gave Tom Cruise the task of doing for their Dark Universe what Robert Downey, Jr. did for Marvel, Gal Godot (finally) did for DC and J.J. Abrams did for Disney.2017's \"The Mummy\" is the first in which the title character is a woman, and it's true what they say: Hell hath no fury like a woman mummy scorned. Or, in this case, denied the throne. In her fictional backstory set in ancient Egypt's Middle Kingdom, Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) is next in line to rule Egypt, until the pharaoh's new wife gives him a son. Ahmanet retaliates by killing all three of them and making a deal with the devil, whom the ancient Egyptians called Set. This god of the desert, storms, disorder and violence gives Ahmanet super powers and all she has to do is sacrifice her lover by stabbing him with a special knife so Set can inhabit his body. But before she can complete the act, she is captured by the palace guards and then transported 1,000 miles away to Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) where she is mummified and buried alive in a large underground cavern, surrounded by statues of gods to guard her, hieroglyphic warnings of danger if her tomb is disturbed and liquid mercury, to weaken her evil powers.Cruise plays Nick Morton, a former soldier who is now a soldier of fortune, stealing antiquities for personal profit\u0085 Indiana Jones without scruples. Nick is in war-torn Iraq with his partner in crime Chris Vale (Jake Johnson) looking for the legendary tomb of Ahmanet. They find it, with the help of a map that he stole from archaeologist Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis), (after sleeping with her) and a well-timed, well-placed U.S. military air strike called in to disperse armed insurgents. When Jenny catches up with Nick and sees what he has unearthed, she demands that an Army colonel (Courtney B. Vance) use one of his helicopters to lift Ahmanet's sarcophagus out of its resting place and put in on a plane to fly it to London. On the way, Chris becomes possessed by Ahmanet's evil, a flock of birds flies through the cockpit and the plane crashes, with Nick still aboard. Yet he survives. British scientist Dr. Edward Jekyll (Russell Crowe, prepping for a Dark Universe movie of his own) tells Nick that Ahmanet has chosen him to help her and Set take over the world. Then, Ahmanet escapes, chaos ensues and only Nick can stop it.\"The Mummy\" is as dumb and ridiculous as it sounds. It doesn't have the scariness of Boris Karloff's films or the fun of Brendan Fraser's. This one's attempted scares come from its visual effects (which aren't much better than in 1999's \"The Mummy\") and its attempts at fun come from misplaced whimsy in the characters and supposedly comedic moments and lines that aren't very funny and are so frequent that they distract from the main plot, which is supposed to be tense and frightening. Screenwriters David Koepp (writer of several hits over the previous few years), Christopher McQuarrie (another successful screenwriter, who also directed \"Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation\" and \"Jack Reacher\") and Dylan Kussman (a career actor, co-writing his first movie) throw together elements that have worked in recent horror and superhero movies, but they end up with a confused mess of a story.Director Alex Kurtzman (a long-time writer and producer who is directing his first major movie) can't seem to make sense of the script either\u0085 or strike any kind of reasonable tonal balance\u0085 or give his actors any kind of direction that makes their characters likable or even believable. Clearly trying to follow Marvel's template for its uber-successful MCU films, this movie instead flounders worse than the early Batman and Superman movies of the DC Extended Universe. Unless Universal quickly finds its equivalent of \"Wonder Woman\", the Dark Universe franchise is in trouble. In this version of \"The Mummy\", Ahmanet was buried for 5,000 years before she emerged, every bit as disagreeable as before. I'd suggest burying this movie for 5,000 years, but it probably wouldn't get better with age either. \"D+\""}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "I find most people are complaining about this film because they're comparing it to the Brendan Fraser films, why? Because it has the same name? That's ridiculous, shall we compare it to the 1930's Mummy, well it has the same name so yes we must apparently!Judge it on it's own merits, it's got action, horror and a surprising amount of comedy, overall it is a very good film and I highly recommend seeing it."}]
