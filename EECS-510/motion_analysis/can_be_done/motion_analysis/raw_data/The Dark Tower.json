[{"score": "5/10", "review": "\"The Dark Tower\" is based on the book series of the same name by Stephen King and is a continuation of that series. The movie focuses on the Gunslinger (Idris Elba), who must do battle with the Man In Black (McConaughey) to stop him from destroying the Dark Tower which holds all the universes together and protect a boy Jake from the Man in Black.I was not excited for this movie at all. The trailers made the movie looks very cheaply made but after seeing this at an advanced screening I have to say it was awful like I was expecting it to be. It also wasn't very good. Idris Elba has and will continue to be a great actor and he proves it with his performance in this movie, arguably being the best of the movie even with the material he's given. Surprisingly, the child actors were serviceable. They didn't suck. I mean I'm not gonna write home about them or anything but they served their purpose and I found them to be decent while watching.For the first 15-20 minutes of the movie, the movie sets up a really cool premise and story that you are hoping it evolves. This first act kept me invested and interested even if the characters weren't all that great. After this section, things started to go downhill.I just lost interest in the movie after that. To be honest, it was a pretty boring and uneventful movie. It's just a series of action sequences and a villain with a big bad plan and little to none of the so-called \"Dark Tower.\" My interest waned. It just became something I hoped it wouldn't.Matt McConaughey is not good in the movie. I will give credit where credit is though because he tried, but it did not work. He is not a good villain. He's just not menacing at all, and the villain was pretty bland. This movie is also a very confused movie. Not it's not confusing, but it itself is confused at to what it wants to be. There were times I felt it was trying to be serious, and others where humor dominated the scene and the movie was trying to be campy. That really didn't work all that well either. This movie is also really, really short. Without credits, it's 88 minutes (95 minutes with credits). Like....what? It made everything seem really forced and rushed and the movie had no real flow to it.I am going to give \"The Dark Tower\" a C-.Here is my review on YouTube for a further and more in-depth analysis of my review of \"The Dark Tower.\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2q0qCEDTm8"}, {"score": "4/10", "review": "Caught an advanced screening of this earlier tonight (it opens tomorrow night officially) and while it wasn't particularly good, i thought it was OK enough in that it was watchable (the pacing of the film is all right enough) and that Idris Elba was good as The Gunslinger and while he's very, very dry and laconic which he's of course supposed to be, he give what I thought was an effective performance on the whole. (and honestly even the actor who played the kid who is in fact the narrative focal point of the movie is fine enough, he's not terrible) (McCounaghey is effectively evil with his constant deadpan, but its not really much of a role for him, he's kind of just there but he's OK in the part.) There are to be sure a lot of flaws in the film. Just a lot of things in the film could have been better on the whole...BUT it should be said that while a lot of people will probably hate this film or try and make it out to be one of the worst of the year, it was not nearly that bad, its not Battlefield Earth level quality here. It just wasn't all that good either. Quality wise on the whole i would say the film is like right in that middle ground area there where you can shrug your shoulders and say it was all right i guess and then you go right ahead and pick it apart with your friend afterwards (which is more or less what I did) But again I thought it was watchable enough despite its drawbacks as a whole but if you really need to know, the effects fall more than a little on the chintzy side (my friend said the effects budget seemed like it was rather limited) and that the grand epic fight scene that the film should have been building up to falls a good ways short of being epic. (same friend said that this actually falls in line with the ending of the first novel saying as how that first novel's ending was also pretty anti climactic) But end fight scene aside, i can imagine this film airing on a regular basis on basic cable either on Syfy or TNT and people watching it again and again in that way will probably be right in line with the quality level of the film. Bottom line--its all right enough for a night out with friends, but its also really not worth the effort of going out too as well if going out requires much of an effort. Its not all that great, but it wasn't terrible either...it was average...quite average.I say this as someone who never read the books, however if you have read the books, I really, really hope you don't go in with sky high expectations. Since I haven't read the books can i state here that i thought the film played like a greatest hits collection of Stephen King's past works? You got a little bit of The Shining here, you got a little bit of The Stand there, mix and stir and serve! again i'm not saying it was bad, but the books had to be better than that right? I got a friend who is obsessed with the books and is dreading seeing this, so I'm kind of nervous what his reaction will end up being although I think I can predict it'll be on the negative side. But even with that i hope he'll at least think that Idris Elba was decent enough...at least i'll try and argue that."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "Although clearly a derivative work (and never advertised as anything else), the film stays loyal to the \"spirit\" of the Dark Tower books. It is also a very efficiently written movie. Every scene, and every second has something important going on, there is indeed no filler going on.Overall very solid performance from the cast. Matthew McConaughey is a perfect Man in Black, and Idris Elba is as good for Roland Deschain as he looks in the trailer (Mc Conaughey is better than the trailer!). Tom Taylor is a really great incarnation of Jake Chambers, a 100% authentic Steven King character. The other actors make the best they can with the time they're given on screen. Even the supporting actors give great, realistic, powerful, convincing performance.The Lore is 100% true to the books, there are no insertions and no kind of political stupidity, merely some artistic license here and there.So if you loved the books, or even if you didn't, absolutely go watch this film, it will be a lot of fun and definitely worth your time."}, {"score": "1/10", "review": "This could be a good movie series.

Then there are those fans who loved the books, so they delude themselves into thinking the movie is good enough. Frankly the history of Stephen King material and film is a mixed bag. The Shining is obviously superior, but when's the last time you dug out Dreamcatcher? It just continues to shock me how inept some of these productions are."}, {"score": "4/10", "review": "This film, which was inspired, not adapted from the Stephen King novels of the same name, takes a sweeping epic, dumbs it down, loses the focus and lazily tries to make it look cool for a younger audience. This film is bad and I went in with an open mind, hoping to find some redeeming qualities about it. While there are some good ideas, I can't help but feel that this will be somewhat heartbreaking for fans of the books who were actually excited to see it. Jake Chambers is a young boy who suffers from horrific nightmares. In those nightmares, he sees The Man in Black, who kidnaps children and uses a device to suck their minds right out of their head. All in an effort to destroy the Dark Tower. The Dark Tower is the centre of the universe, protecting all worlds from the evil that lies beyond, out in the darkness. Roland, the last of the Gunslingers, soldiers sworn to protect the tower, is on a mission to kill The Man in Black. When Jake discovers a portal that leads to their world, he jumps in and finds Roland. Together they must stop The Man in Black, or their world and all worlds, will end. I couldn't help but think to myself, that people would never want to see a film that was loosely inspired by The Lord of the Rings. They would much rather see that literary masterpiece adapted to the big screen. Imagine Peter Jackson used the same characters and made a different story, but still slapped the title on it? So I can't help but wonder why they thought it would be a good idea to loosely adapt The Dark Tower and not do a straight adaption from the books. I kind of get the idea they were going for, in regards to how the book series ends, but they missed the mark and by a wide margin. I'm sure fans of the series would pick up numerous nods to the books here and there, but that is not enough. Graffiti on the wall of Hailing The Crimson King will get a knowing nod from people, but that's it. I'm sure they would rather see the actual story from the books on the screen. Arcel and writer Goldsman, oversimplify an epic story into a 90 some odd minute shoot em up. Sure, it looks cool when Elba reloads his guns, but I want something more than that. It doesn't help that the film essentially has two and a half action sequences, which might look neat to those who haven't seen a film like John Wick. Elba does his best with the clunky dialogue, but he can't save it. McConaughey chews up the scenery, as expected. His character is \"worse than the devil\". He can kill people by simply telling them to stop breathing. He does this numerous times. He can catch bullets, incinerate people, basically force anyone to do anything. Mucho powerful. But here's the expository dialogue part \"Roland, you've always been immune to my magic, haven't you?\" So there you have it, he can't hurt our hero in the \"stop breathing\" category. He can still use the force to hurl objects at him and watching McConaughey move his hands around to control items like broken glass or rocks is unintentionally comical. Bad special effects plague this film. There is a sequence at night where a demon, which apparently breaks through the barrier, attacks Roland and Jake. It's hard to make out what it looks like, or what the heck is going on. But in the end does it matter? Who know the Gunslinger will eventually put it out of its misery. I snickered at seeing how bad they rendered humans falling around or getting hit by cars. It only happens a few times in one particular sequences, but it's something that still hasn't been perfected and probably never will. The entire film feels clunky, unexplained or unexplored. I never got a sense of Roland's world. There are abandoned structures all over and they have no idea what they were used for, but we clearly know they are carnival rides, as does Jake. How does anyone who never read the books have a clue as to what this means. Arcel seems uninterested in exploring that side of the story and instead streamlines it from point A to point B. This isn't a story to do that, especially if the goal is to branch it off into a series. I suspect this will be the only film they make. With generic action sequences, oversimplification of an epic story, shoddy effects and some questionable performances (Jake's friend is the biggest offender), The Dark Tower is a big missed opportunity. Here is a series that could have been several films, sweeping multiple genres and taking viewers on a ride they probably wouldn't of forgotten. Instead we get this film that I already have forgotten. Ho-hum, despite a big budget, we have yet another King adaption failure."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "Stephen King is a master of many things, and Hollywood has never been afraid to capitalize on the epic tales he has crafted over the years. This weekend his legendary Dark Tower series gets its own chance to \"shine\" and prove to fans that the series can continue on. Did Sony studios plan to make a \"sequel\" to the books thrive, or will if fall victim to the shortcuts the film industry often takes. Robbie K here to share his thoughts on another movie. Why don't we get started then?LIKES:Nice Set Up: Doing my research, I realized where the directors were planning on taking this film franchise and the books it is based on. The Dark Tower acts as a \"sequel\" to the books and builds as an introduction to the series. It sets a nice framework up for those who haven't read the series and prepares us for an adventure that could span multiple films/shows in the future. It has simplified the complexity of King's work and thrown hints at how his worlds are connected, perhaps inspiring some rewatching of his classics. Action Scene: Dark Tower primarily is about opening us up to a world and setting the pieces and that unfortunately doesn't bring much action. However, the group managed to put a dazzling piece together involving our gunslinger and a round of minions. Idris Elba finally gets to show off his legendary skills, outside of acting, as the lone gunslinger in his quest to stop the forces of evil. The stunts are epic, the editing is on point, and the violence is contained to not be overly gory but still strong enough to be considered action instead of a bland use of a gun. It took the movie long enough to get to this point, but I thoroughly enjoyed the climax fight. The Acting: I'm not calling this the world's best acting, or even Oscar Worthy on most levels, but the acting is decent in the Dark Tower. Tom Taylor as the new kid with the shine, does a decent job playing the troubled, awkward kid and portraying that strange view of the world. His other emotions, however, needs a little work as these come off dry, awkward, and sometimes a bit underwhelming given the circumstance. Matthew McConaughey brings his Lexus commercial approach to the mix, the cool delivery of his lines, holding an air of superiority and malicious intent. He has the villain role down and instills a bit of chill when he appears on the scene. Of course, the champion of this movie is Idris himself, hitting the role with 100% accuracy. Elba's got the rogue part down and the edgy, loner bravado brings the bang to the proverbial gun. And the chemistry Elba has with his cast only amps up his skills, a talent I always like to see. DISLIKES:Rushed: Sure the movie made a nice framework for introducing the series to nonreaders, it failed to deliver those important details. The Dark Tower leaves a lot questions unanswered in terms of the origins of all the pieces involved in this war. As for the parts they do fill in, these are lacking on so many levels, lacking real depth or mystery to get you hooked into the film. Even worse, much of the quest has little in regards to obstacles, with most problems being solved with little effort. You get to hear all about the things lying in wait, but their actual involvement in the movie is little to none. While this not only limits the story, it also limits the special effects and creature design we could have gotten as well. A few CGI and makeup effects stand out, but the Dark Tower's first film is rather lackluster given the potential of King's books. Anticlimactic: Much of the movie is rather dull, drawn out in a manner of theoretical talks of ideal brain power, anarchy, and abduction. All the fancy words and magic didn't help a limited dialog that can be boiled down into a single-minded set of plots that we hear over and over again. When things finally get going, and all the hot air from the cast is lit aflame\u0085 the action barely catches light before being snuffed out. With the exception of one scene (see likes), The Dark Tower's gun slinging is not what I expected. This is particular true for the final fight between antagonist and protagonist that was more lame than impressive. All the hype and rivalry to end so abruptly, not the direction I would have taken. Predictable/Lazy: There was so much potential placed on this movie, and the trailer painted what could have been an epic adventure. Yet, somewhere the film fell victim to cheap shortcuts, low use of nightmarish effects, and a direction that went down the wrong tangent for an opening. It felt uninspired and lazy at times, and perhaps they cut a lot of good parts to fit into the short run time. The VERDICT:Overall the Dark Tower is not bad when you understand the plan to expand upon in the years to come. As a stand-alone film, it does the job of introducing characters and the world, but it failed to reel me into the full-on adventure. With a rushed plot, easy challenges, and lazy production approach, this film is mediocre at best given the hype of everything. Therefore, this reviewer recommends holding off seeing this film until Redbox gets it in stock. My scores:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 6.5 Movie Overall: 6.0"}, {"score": "5/10", "review": "I had the opportunity to watch an early screening of The Dark Tower. I was not sure what to expect, but I know there has been a lot of hype surrounding this movie because it's based on Stephen King's novels.Let's get straight to the point. This movie was marketed as something epic and grand, but unfortunately it falls flat. It seemed like it wanted to be many things, but at the same time it did not know what it wanted to be.Story: It's a rehash of many plots we have seen over and over. I am fine with reusing plots, but this is done borderline terribly. There are too many ifs and whys asked throughout the movie. There are no backstory to where this Mid-world or other communities come from or how they are connected to our world. I saw a lot of potential, especially in the first 15 minutes, but sadly it never felt the need to explain to the audience about their myth and lore. Furthermore, it's supposed to be a grand epic tale, but it takes many easy ways out or disregards the possible challenges completely. The story also brushes off any real emotional depths. There were some comedy here and there that did make me chuckle, but it was not good enough to pull back from the heavy nonsensical plot.Characters: They are very generic characters that we have once again seen a million times. And once again I don't mind seeing a generic tale about generic characters if it's done properly (with heart and soul). However, these characters are two dimensional. Their goals and motives are weak and lack purpose. They are basically black and white. There are also too many ifs and why the characters do what they do. No backstories or justice were given to them. As a matter of fact, there were several random characters who were inserted for the sake of letting the time tick. It gave no true purpose to the main plot. Very pitiful.Acting: Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey are huge stars, and they managed well with what the script and dialogues had to offer them. I also thought the protagonist, and young star, Tom Taylor, and the protagonist's mom, Katheryn Winnick were great. They honestly deserved better than this movie.Script + Dialogue: I don't understand how these actors can act through these horrible dialogues. The line that the gunslinger always says in the trailer is used throughout the entire movie. It is supposed to carry depth, but it passes off as being cheesy. It's supposed to hold meaning, but it falls under the dirt. There are several other dialogues with The Man in Black that passes off as a two dimensional power hunger villain. Imagine a villain who is finger-tenting while planning something masterful, but take away anything masterful about it. He just looks ridiculous.Action + Editing: There are lack of action scenes, which can be understandable given the runtime. The shooting scenes that we have seen in trailers look pretty awesome, but we don't get much more than what we see in the trailers. Moreover, the editing felt choppy. There are many black out scenes and zoom out of cities or scenery that just felt out of place and took up too much runtime for no purpose.Guys, in the end, despite all the nasty criticism I have for this movie, it was only 1h35min, so I did not feel bored out of my mind. There were a lot of slow scenes, but I was never completely bored because I kept waiting around for \"a\" great moment. It never happened. Even at the climax, I was hoping that it was not the climax. I walked out of this movie feeling numb and content, but then I realized that content was not enough for a movie of this caliber, and I was being too easy on it. The sad part about this movie is that by the end of it, you realized nothing has progressed and it was a mess of nothingness.My 4.5/10 stars goes out to its could have been potential and acting department."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "I am a HUGE fan of Stephen King and a HUGE fan of The Dark Tower series.I went to the cinema disappointed because of the reviews and i got out with a big smile on my face.Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey were excellent,the kid who played Jake Chambers was excellent.The story was great an Mid-world was what i imagined it to be. it was an amazing film,definitely worth my time."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "I've been looking forward to seeing this movie for a few years, I've read all the books including the more recent one ('The Wind Thru the Keyhole') and other books that Walter appeared in. It's currently 2017, and anyone who hasn't learned the 'book to movie' lesson by now needs to finally learn it so that they can also enjoy movies what they are, which is an extra bonus for a book that is well liked by a lot of people. If the movie actually turns out good than all the better, but being more realistic about movies not having to live up to the books they're based on is best thing to do so you don't end up like the rest of these bitter people who leave the movie theater as quickly as possible just to come back home and write a 'nerd'tastic negative one starred review expressing all their deep down inner angst in the most pathetic form possible. Luckily I beat many of them to the punch before they tore this fun and entertaining movie apart, and I did find it entertaining thanx to having zero expectations about it, go ahead and try it next time you go to a similar movie, you'll at least temporarily enjoy yourself. Whining and complaining about trivial things isn't good for you or anyone else anyways.I thought they did a fairly good job considering all the various challenges that this potential movie presented them, and the fact that it at one point seemed like it may never even get released or get just get much further delayed didn't make the project seem as promising as it did when first hearing about it's production a few years back for the first time. I got my expectations up very high when I first heard about it, but as time went on I would settle for just about anything decent, and 'decent' it sure was, though I'll rate the movie a 10 to make up for one or two reviews from the Negative Nancys of IMDb. I'm happy to see that Sony left this open for a sequel, It's still not a for sure thing if they'll make another, though King seems to think they will, but I'd pay a lot of money to see a movie based of the backstory from 'Wizard and Glass'.Bottom line: Have fun, it's a fun movie whether you have read the books or not. Not a bad choice for the kids either, lot of action, no nudity, and not much cussing from what I recall, (12+ is my guess depending on who you are, ratings can be deceiving).If you haven't read the books: Read them if you're an avid reader, you won't regret it, but if you're just an average reader then the 8 books will take you far too long to get thru and you'll probably give up and have wasted a lot of time trying. One trick is just to be disciplined enough to read every single day if possible, and it doesn't even have to be much because it will add up over the course of year, and if you were to read 10 - 15 pages per day every day you'd be able to finish 'The Dark Tower' series within one year. (Quick easy formula: 365 days per year, very roughly 365 pages per book, so 5 pages per day will get you thru 5 books per year, and not difficult at all to make that 40 pages per day, and at the end of the year you will have read 40 BOOKS! Probably more books than you've ready in your life, just got to form the habit first and go from there, keep track with a notebook to stay disciplined if you have to). Other King suggestions: 'The Shining' Even better than the movie, and possibly underrated because of the movie's popularity, and the fact most people are too lazy to read. 'The Eyes of the Dragon' Walter is a main character, and King once again digs into the darkness of the man's psyche while weaving a great story in Medieval times. 'The Stand' The ultimate apocalyptic adventure with Walter doing what he does best, and the fate of the lives of dozens of different characters all linked to Walter thru their dreams of him, and has 1000 or so pages to all find each other and come together to somehow stop him while avoiding much betrayal and many obstacles along the beaten path that is led and aided by their other dreams of another character who is out to help them find where they need to be going. 'Different Seasons' No, it's not a story about a possessed spice rack) This book includes four novellas (short novels). Most of you will recognize of 2 or 3 of the others as those were all turned into good movies ('The Shawshank Redemption' 'Apt Pupil' and 'The Body' AKA 'Stand By Me'), and just as is usually the case are far superior to the films, and not that the films are bad at all. It's just the reality that books always beat movies, it's no contest at all, but movies are a time for us to do something unproductive and be happy while doing it. So don't be like these sad saps who would actually pay for a movie knowing very well that they'll not have a good time. One of the secrets to life is 'to have a good time when you're able to', and if you like to laugh at bad movies that are trying to be serious then you need to finally get yourself on the MST3K and Rifftrax bandwagon."}, {"score": "10/10", "review": "This is the adult version of The Never Ending Story.

The special effect guys did a very good job. The fight scenes with Roland shooting bullets in slow-motion and Walter O'Dim's scenes were extremely fun to watch. -The actors: In my opinion the actors did a pretty good job. They did their best with the horrible script the writers handed to them.And now the negative aspects: -Awful writing: I have no idea how can four (!!!) writers create a stupid dialog and story like this. It's not even the book's fault, because as I know the story is completely different than the one of the books'. -The constant switching between the two worlds, the involvement of the \"asian medium lady\" and her village, the repetitive usage of the Warriors' praying were so unimportant that it makes me mad. Not to mention the ending...as if it was made for 6 years olds. -Sloppy directing: The director was nominated for BAFTA Award, so I am pretty sure he just did not give a damn about making the movie at least mediocre with the absence of a proper script. The cuts in this movie (when there's no fight) are very annoying, and I am pretty sure I could have cut it to be more watchable than Nikolaj Arcel did (and I have not directed anything yet).Summary: The books had a perfect material to create an excellent movie series, but someone decided to create an upset, a ruined cinematography from it. I am pretty sure it is the fault of the negligence of the people behind this movie (writers;director). If a Sergio Leone directed this movie with the given universe, it would have become a classic.

If they get some traction with this one, then the subsequent movies/TV series get twice the money to work with. I personally think that they did a fantastic job with this first effort. The acting was solid. The story was actually pretty good. It had some great actions sequences, and the CGI was surprisingly good (most of the time). It was also a very efficient use of time. Every scene helped explain the Dark Tower lore to new audiences. It was a fun action flick that doesn't try to repeat the experience of reading the books. I'll always have the novels. I wasn't expecting this movie to recreate that experience for me.Plus, as a die hard fan from way back, it was just great to see Roland and Jake on screen for the first time. It just felt right. Give it a try with an open mind."}, {"score": "6/10", "review": "If you never\u00a0invested the many hours\u00a0of reading\u00a0it takes to tackle the eight book and\u00a0massively wordy series from Stephen King that the film is based upon,\u00a0then you probably would think the \"The Dark Tower\" isn't half bad despite the overwhelming hate the film is getting from critics. Critics are panning the film\u00a0but is it because they know it took four writers, a massive effort with lots of setbacks to deliver the hour and thirty-five minute film? Is it because there is an expectation that the film should reflect everything\u00a0that happened in all eight books?\u00a0Is it because\u00a0they expect the screen adaption to be more like a trilogy akin to \"The Lord of the Rings?\" Is it that they don't know \"The Dark Tower\" is actually a sequel to the books. Yes, it's a sequel. If you read the books then you may recall that the worlds are on a wheel, representing that life repeats. Roland defeated The Man in Black, but then Roland knew it was all going to happen again. This next time would be different and the film represents the next life of Roland. If you set all that you know about the long tale that the film is based upon and just watch \"The Dark Tower\" as is, the film stands on it's own two feet. It has a beginning, middle, and an ending that makes sense. It's paced evenly. Has an intriguing story, excellent villain in casting McConaughey, and it's a fantasy. So why the massive hate out there? There are two distinct ways to view the film. One is with a background in Stephen King (which I have), and one without. I chose to judge the film based on it's own merits rather than expecting it to somehow encompass the eight novels (that would perhaps have worked better as a TV series as first pitched\u00a0long ago). It's the only fair way to judge a film. Complaining that the film took ten years, a zillion directors who came and went, etc. should have no bearing on the finished work. The truth is, some films take more effort than others. Sony thinks the effort was worth it and is counting on Stephen King fans to turn out and see the film.\u00a0However,\u00a0this is where the issue may lie, and unfairly so. If you are a film studio and you green light\u00a0a\u00a0movie counting on that built- in fan base, then you should try and stick to the source material but the plausibility of that happening is near to zero. That's not opinion. You can't take eight books and cram it into a film. A percentage of critics seem to think that justifies burying the film in negative reviews. \"The Dark Tower\" isn't \"The Lord of the Rings\" but to some it could have been, and therein lies the root behind the lousy reviews generally. Expectation is sometimes\u00a0hard to curb especially in this case because of the source material. The solution lies in the marketing. The studio\u00a0should have made\u00a0a better effort in delivering\u00a0\u00a0a message that stressed that \"The Dark Tower\" is a loosely based adaptation of King's work and most importantly\u00a0that it's a sequel to the books.\u00a0There were a lot of interviews out there beforehand that could have highlighted the nature of how King ended the books to curb expectations. Additionally, marketing could have better opened minds that the under- lining goal was to create a version that worked in less than 2 hours for the big screen and not have King fans expecting the next \"Lord of the Rings\" -esque cinematic experience. The expectation is not set appropriately and the critical scores fairly/unfairly reflect this.\"The Dark Tower\" stands on it's own two feet when not held in context to its source material as the creators wanted.\u00a0Yes, screenwriters chose to gloss over the deeper dynamics of the source material in lieu of a faster, perhaps less meaningful overall story. Despite that, the story is still balanced, characters motivations make sense, and it's evenly paced. The studio undoubtedly is counting on Stephen King fans to fill the seats this weekend and that's where the expectation\u00a0may fall short because of critics panning the film. You can't expect built-in fan support for a project that doesn't deliver on the source material.\u00a0Unfortunately, and fair or not, \"The Dark Tower\" doesn't deliver on King's opus work simply because his tale is too massive for the medium and should be done via episodic TV (if done at all).\u00a0\u00a0Cinematically \"The Dark Tower\" equates to a nice diversion and probably won't stay in the minds of moviegoers as anything special. It rises to just above mediocrity. \u00a0If you either watch the film as a stand-alone, or with the idea that it's a sequel to the\u00a0eight books it's based upon, you may get more out of it. Final Verdict: 2.5 out of 5"}, {"score": "5/10", "review": "A paint-by-the-numbers \"epic\" story with a prolific number of Stephen King references. Adapted from the\u00a0Dark Tower series of novels by Stephen King,\u00a0Dark Tower introduces movie audiences to one of King's masterpiece works of literature. Unfortunately, the movie takes place in the middle of the series and fails to leave audiences wanting to see more. For the most part, it offers up little more than an enhanced SyFy Channel original movie or a one-time HBO film. With a powerhouse leading cast consisting of Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, it constantly feels that the actors were held back from that which we are normally accustomed. That is, not to say that there aren't enjoyable parts of the movie--certainly seeing all the King references are fun and it is a great premise. I only wish the story and characters had been allowed to develop over the course of three films. Although there is sufficient evidence to suggest that some movies in the recent past that have been forced into a trilogy instead of a strong, concise single film, this is an example of a one- time film that truly needed the room of three films to develop and emotionally connect with audiences. There is never a dull moment in the film, nor an opportunity to become bored because the film is incredibly rushed and turning points are forced into place.At the center of the universe stands a massively tall dark tower that keeps the bulk of evil forces at bay. Under attack by Walter (McConaughey), the last gunslinger Rolland (Elba) must destroy Walter and his following before they destroy the dark tower and wreak havoc on Keystone Earth and the other planets in the universe. Harvesting children with \"the shine\" from earth, to use their minds to destroy the tower, is the method employed by Walter and he has his eyes on a child whose shine is greater than any other. After Jake (Tom Taylor) evades capture by Walter's henchmen, he finds himself on Mid World where he meets gunslinger Rolland. Under constant siege by Water, Rolland and Jake must make a arduous journey to Walter's headquarters where he is mounting his attack against the tower. With the fate of the universe at stake, Rolland, Walter, and Jake face-off in an epic battle of good versus evil.There is not much to dissect here. One thing is for sure--and I have not read the books--BUT, from what I know of the books, fans of the literature will not like the film because it takes what happens over the course of \"King\" sized novels and condenses it down to little more than a short story turned 2hr film. Not having read the books, I was not set up for disappointment. That being the case, I enjoyed the film for the most part. But it was obvious that it was incredibly rushed and there was little if any development in plot or character. No emotional investment to be found. It's a shame; the premise of the film is fascinating and I think there is a high degree of probability that I would have enjoyed following the franchise had it been more than one film. The way the movie ends does lend itself to possible sequels, but after the very \"television\" feel of this one, it is going to have a hard time convincing future audiences to invest time and spend money on it. If anything, this film does prompt me to read the novels upon which it is based. One argument that could be made in the film's defense is the same one that can be made when looking at many of the films based upon King's works. His novels are so dense, internally driven, and detailed that is is difficult to successfully translate effectively from page to screen. Obviously, there are exceptions to this trend (i.e. the upcoming\u00a0IT theatrical release).If you are a fan of fantasy and adventure films with a hint of science-fiction, then you will likely enjoy this movie. If you love the series of books, I feel fairly confident that you will not like this adaptation. Perhaps this film will inspire a network to spearhead an epic television series. I think that is where this story will be best shown.Written by R.L. TerryEdited by J.M. Wead"}, {"score": "4/10", "review": "As far as fantasy series go, Dark Tower is my second favorite. (Lord of the Rings is the first, of course.) Stephen King's magnum opus is a wonder to behold with rich lore, fascinatingly complex characters and a plot that was far ahead of its time. Unlike this lazy film, the books are engrossing and draw inspiration from vast sources ranging from King Crimson to JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Sergio Leone's The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.The books read like an epic poem, with Stephen King drawing influence from famous poetry such as Robert Browning's 'Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came,' and TS Elliot's 'The Wastelands.' He even went as far as naming the third book, The Wastelands. The novels are wonderful and tell a truly incredible tale full of love, hate, betrayal and a classic good versus evil.It's a dark fantasy story with exceptionally adult themes and graphic violence. The story is also long. The books take place over 4,200 pages and over one million two hundred thousand words. With story elements ranging from time travel, world travel, paradoxes, Arthurian legend and the multiverse theory, the series was named as unadaptable for film. And unfortunately, it looks like the skeptics were correct.The Dark Tower is unadaptable for a film. The books are too dense, and the story and lore are too complicated to roll out in just a few hours. If the series was given the Game of Thrones treatment by a major TV studio such as HBO or Netflix, then we would be sitting on something undeniably special. Interestingly enough, HBO actually had the rights for the series back in 2010; they gave up the show due to the complexity of the plot and budget fears. The next year they went on to successfully adapt Game of Thrones which set a new bar for production cost\u0085 the fact that HBO was too scared to adapt Dark Tower, but was willing to try Game of Thrones says legions about how difficult of a series this is to tackle.A decade in the making, Dark Tower has finally arrived and it's a disappointing mess on par with last year's adaptation of the classic series, Berserk. (Maybe not that bad, but it's pretty darn close) The film carries the title, \"The Dark Tower,\" and it features characters that are named Roland, Jake and the elusive Man in Black, but nearly everything else about the series has been brutally slaughtered, altered or just forgotten. Sai King might have told Nikolaj Arcel that he has remembered the face of his father, but with a score of 34 on metacritic and a disastrous 16% on Rotten Tomatoes, it's clear that Nikolaj Arcel and Sony Pictures are agents of the Crimson King.From the very beginning of the film, things are a complete mess. In terms of editing, writing and overall direction, very little makes sense. The film never bothers to explain where places are, or why things are happening, or who certain characters are. Unless you have read the books, then I imagine you will be pretty lost on what is going on. If you have read the books, which you really should, then you'll be shaking your head and laughing in disbelief as you watch beloved story lines get thrashed into oblivion.The film doesn't focus on the protagonist in the books, Roland. Instead it focuses on his spiritual son, Jake; and don't get me wrong, I absolutely adore Jake. He's one of my favorite literary characters. But when you're adapting a very established universe, it's probably not a smart decision to change who the protagonist is. Jake is a great character, but he can't carry the story in the same way that Roland can. There's very little focus on the entire plot. There were strong rumors of a troubled development and numerous reshoots, and unfortunately that is extremely apparent in this film. Scenes drag out for far too long or too little, and the film fails to elaborate on necessary plot points, and instead dwells on the unnecessary which unfortunately, falls into the realm of the clich\u00e9. (Of course Jake is bullied)The dialogue is laughably bad and some of the side characters, which are not in the books, have some horrendous acting chops. Jake's friend and Arra are negative standouts. I have a problem with them introducing new one dimensional characters over classic ones from the books. I don't know what the logic was behind that, but I disapprove.Contrary to the bad acting of the ensemble, the two leads do a superb job with what they are given. Elba shines as Roland. It's unfortunate that he's written so poorly and stuck in this film instead of a better adaptation. He carries the gravitas of a gunslinger, and it's incredibly sad that he's forced to perform in some terrible scenes. One scene with his father was cringe worthy. McConaughey was my ideal choice for the Man in Black. And despite some horrendous dialogue (\"Have a nice apocalypse!\"), he manages to be excellent. It's such a shame that two stellar castings are overshadowed by complete nonsense the studio inflicted.The film was made with a modest budget of sixty million. This is exceptionally small for a fantasy film, which means the director and writers had to make the best of every scene\u0085 but instead they put in at least three chase scenes and random CGI monsters that no doubt took up millions of the budget. Those unnecessary scenes could have been used to expanded the story instead.The Dark Tower is a disappointing mess that barely resembles the excellent source material. I strongly recommend the novels to you if you have not read them. I'm hoping this film flunks, and that we'll get a better adaption in a couple years. Until then, we can only wait."}, {"score": "7/10", "review": "First of all I have to say few words to defend The Dark Tower movie. Movie based on very faintly to the book series and Stephen Kings created universe and it be only a scratch to achieve a grater story. In a way this movie is thought to be a kind of prequel of the series, I think. As a independent movie it works quite mediocre, not to tell too much what might to happen. So if you want to see more and dive deeper to this universe, I suggested you to invest some effort to this movie, at least to buy a movie ticket. Perhaps studio has been too modest and didn't have guts to invest enough to start this movie series well enough.Because movie company (Sony) has left to go on a fishing expedition, the only thing to blame (or thank) is company itself. Not the fans nor other audience. Me, myself went to see this movie with very mixed feelings. Especially, when I noted this movie is only 95 minutes long, I was wondering how on earth they can even scratch this universe. And they haven't. The movie introduces us to three main characters of book series and gives us only a glimpses of hint what the whole story has to offer. With this on plate they try to wake audiences interest to see more. In a way it works, but the other way it doesn't. Fans must be furious after years of waiting, when result is only bits of pieces of The Dark Tower universe. The other way movie might (just might) be a stimulant to audience who does not be familiar with Stephen Kings series of TDT books. Everything has left to the box office to tell of it's success. Movie audience is tried to address with low age certification (PG-13). Every one who are familiar with Stephen Kings books knows, that they are not any children stories.As a movie itself is very mediocre sci-fi and fantasy movie. To Stephen Kings fans has a little more to offer. It has some nice and thrilling glimpses and hints to other Kings masterpieces like Cujo, The Shining, Christine, movie 14 08 and ti It's Pennywise-clown. These small hints raised a little of my interest about this movie.As a one movie The Dark Tower is oddly confused and thin story. Many things are left to hang in the air and many occurrence are not explained enough. This may revenge itself at the box office simply because big audience is not familiar enough of this peculiar universe. If it wont get enough of audience, it will be pity that they didn't gave enough to earn audiences interest. This universe is so big and bizzar that it earns to told properly. Me, myself I am a little worried, that it won't get enough of audience. Because of that, I encourage you to spend a price of a movie ticket if you even hesitate a little about seeing this movie. Even if it is a mediocre film, it really isn't one of the worst Stephen Kings stories what has converted to a movie. Of course the are many way too better films about SK's books like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, Kathy Bates starred (Oscar winning) role in The Misery or delightful TV series The Stand.If movie don't make enough money at the box office, only thin to blame is movie studio, who didn't got enough guts to invest this movie to tell us a great story, earned enough to tell properly. If movie sunk's at the box office the only thing that may save this story is relying on those big streaming companies like HBO or Netflix who may have guts and money enough to tell us this great story properly. Many favorite characters, like Odetta, Susannah, Oy, Eddie Dean and Blaine waits to be introduce them self.The Dark Tower introduces to us only few characters of series. Idris Elba is superb as a Gunslinger, Matthew Mc Conaughey serves well as a The Man In Black and Tom Taylor is decent as a role of Jake.As a movie The Dark Tower is mediocre, I would say like two and a half of a star movie, but with great actors and with some hints to Stephen King, I have to give this movie one more star. Let just hope, that in the future we will get a change to dive properly to this Stephen Kings bizzar and great universe. That is what all the fans wait to lick your chops."}, {"score": "9/10", "review": "The Dark Tower was something that I have waited (what seems like) eons to see. Idris was absolutely PERFECT as Roland. Jake was well cast, also. Matthew McConaughey, while statuesque & well prepared, was not what I felt The Man in Black embodied. I think that Vince D'Onofrio would have brought Walter to life, IMO. He would have needed a crash diet but as a thespian I think he would have excelled in the role. I think the person who choreographed the fight scenes in John Wick had a hand in this film because Idris/Roland's fight scenes & shooting battles were SPECTACULAR.I think there were certain references in the film that people who have not read the books might find confusing, yet at the same time I recognize that they had to incorporate more action in this first movie then was actually in the first book or people would doze off. This was the first film adaptation of a Stephen King novel that I felt technology was in step with King's imagination. The special effects were on point. For me, I give the film a 10/10. I have waited forever for this and I so want to see the entire 8 book series play out on the big screen. HOWEVER, I do feel that the last 90 seconds of the film deviate from the persona of the Last Gunslinger, Roland Deschain, son of Steven & Gabrielle Deschain, and last of the Line of Eld.
